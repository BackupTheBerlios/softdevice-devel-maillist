</I>Ok, that is probably the best possibility (but please mark the package
as a cvs-version), unfortunately a release of softplay is overdue and
I'm not sure when I will have some time to work on it. Yesterday I just
cleaned up what I got so far and (hopefully) fixed the segmentation
violation which was stopping me from committing the work.

Thank you for packaging all the packages for debian (not only softdevice
and softplay, also for all the other packages)! I'm using debian myself
on one of my machines and it is one of my favourite  distribution.

I still have a packaging related question. I'm not sure if you already
packaged the softdevice-0.2.2, but there is a new feature: the shared
memory client /server, which I find very useful. If you start up the
softdevice with &quot;-vo shm:&quot; it allocates a shared memory segment and
waits for clients, the decoding stays suspended. If you start the shared
memory client (a separate program: ShmClient), it connects to the shared
memory segment, signals that the decoding should be started and displays
the video via Xv. When you close the ShmClient the decoding will be
automatically suspended.
So my question is now: the shmclient has to be linked against a few vdr
objects, is it possible to do that in a debian package?

Bye,
Martin
