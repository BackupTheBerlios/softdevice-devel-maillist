Don't worry, if you processor would not support MMX2 the softdevice
would crash ;-). What the softdevice calls MMX2 is actually a small set
of instructions which is also part of 3Dnow! and is also sometimes
called mmxext. In fact it is only is only PREFETCH and MOVQNT. As far as
I know all Via processors from Erza onwards support these instructions.

Bye,
Martin
