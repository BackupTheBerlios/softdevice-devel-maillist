Thank you for the report, it should be fixed in the CVS now.


&gt;&gt;<i> So my question is now: the shmclient has to be linked against a few vdr

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's a little bit difficult. I can think of the following solutions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The necessary VDR sources are put into the debian package - but this
</I>&gt;<i> makes the source package too dependent on the vdr version
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) The VDR package is modified, to produce a static library, containing
</I>&gt;<i> the needed objects, which is distributed with vdr-dev. That's probably
</I>&gt;<i> the cleanest solution, but I have to speak with Thomas first, because I
</I>&gt;<i> don't want the VDR package at e-tobi.net to be too different from the
</I>&gt;<i> official Debian package.
</I>
Hmm, maybe the cleanest solution is to get rid of the dependency on vdr
objects at all. It is not really needed, it's just because for the first
tries it was the fastest solution. Since I consider the ShmClient
currently as experimental it is probably the best if you just ignore it
in the softdevice-0.2.2 package. I will get rid of the dependencies and
the problem won't be there for the next release :-)


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What's the reason for the SHMClient? Can't this be built directly into
</I>&gt;<i> the plugin? A separate 'launchshmclient' could then trigger the plugin
</I>&gt;<i> to start the SHMClient.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I thought that would be obvious, it is mainly for people who use a
combined vdr/desktop box (like me). When booting my computer vdr is
started with the softdevice shared memory server. I can work without
noticing that vdr is running, and when I want to watch TV I start the
ShmClient.
It may also be useful if one wants to use vdr from a different program,
for example MythTV

Bye,
Martin
