Just for interest: whats your current card ?

&gt;<i> what causes it?

Even if normal audio is streamed as 48KHz or other sample frequencies,
there is slight difference between A/D sampling and D/A conversion.
Let's guess A/D is done at 47990Hz and D/A at 48100Hz. With this
setup it is obvious that you'll get some Xruns during playback.
For PCM output we could think of a resampling logic that adjusts audio
rate to video rate (sync on video).
In case DD5.1 things are more complicated: Decode 5.1, resample
all 6 channels, reencode them to DD5.1 and then output via SPDIF.

With decoding/encoding there could be some patent issues I guess :-( .

&gt;<i> Ill go get a good quality

The ideal solution would be a sound card that would allow some
software controlled adjustments of the PLL which clocks PCM/SPDIF out.
But unfortunatly I've never heard of such a card (or searched for the
wrong keywords).

Another way would be some finetuning of the video refresh rate.

Ideally both (audio and video PLLs) should be adjusted to incoming
reference clock.

For long resync periods of your A/V receiver, I'll think I should
have a closer look at bitstream-out code. This FF-card plugin has
some better underrun and overruns handling code I guess.
