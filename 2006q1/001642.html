As far as I know, a couple of people have mentioned the idea but so far no one 
has managed it (unless it has sneaked into DirectFB when I wasn't looking!). 
The main problem is that the xvmc implementation in Xorg is very tied in to X 
and looks like it would be a nightmare to extract the relevant bits. I might 
have another look, though...

</I>&gt;<i> Don't worry, if you processor would not support MMX2 the softdevice

</I>&gt;<i> I know all Via processors from Erza onwards support these instructions.
</I>
Ahhhh...I was wondering why it wasn't crashing with some random error message 
about unsupported processor features! I might as well rebuild it: I've just 
applied your resolution patch (not that I use anything above 720x576!).

Cheers,

Laz
