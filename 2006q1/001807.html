</I>
720x576 is the usual resolution of an mpeg2 stream, so the softdevice
allocates only a picture buffer of this size. Of course that could be
changed, in fact Xv-Out already has an option(max area) which allows the
allocation of the whole possible area. This depends on the graphics card
(and on it's memory size). I'm not completely sure how that is done in
DFB-out, maybe it's just working out of the box or a few things have to
be changed. I guess Stefan knows this :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I did not test the patch, but there is not much which could go wrong,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some thinks are still to be done inside the softdevice, like saving a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> local copy of the picture (for software osd blending), and we have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discuss how to handle the aspect ratio...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So there are still some open points, but I think this is a starting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> point for discussions :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I have in mind is an vdr-plugin &quot;softimage&quot;, which would the
</I>&gt;<i> replace the existing vdr-image plugin for me. So I ask myself, what
</I>&gt;<i> functions should be provided by such a plugin and what functions
</I>&gt;<i> should belong to softdevice (regarding scaling, aspect ratio etc.)?
</I>&gt;<i> Any suggestions?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>The softdevice currently has only a limited scaling ability (mainly for
the OSD in ARGB/AYUV format). Since there will always be an upper limit
of what can be displayed and there will always be some user how tries to
display a larger image I think the possibility of downscaling of the
images is mandatory, upscaling can easily be done by the YUV hardware
scaler.
About the aspect ratio handling I'm not so sure, Stefan did all the work
there ;-). I guess it is the best to hand over the pictures with an
aspect ratio of 1:1 and the softdevice tries to keep that ratio. As far
as I remember the patch I send you just assumes that the picture is in
the same aspect ratio as the last displayed stream, so that would have
to be changed. Stefan, what do you think?

Bye,
Martin
