Yes. CVS versions get special version numbers like 0.0.1+cvs2006317.

There seems to be some issues with GCC4:

PlayList.c: In member function 'void cItemIdx::Shuffle()':
PlayList.c:246: warning: format '%4d' expects type 'int', but argument 3
has type 'sIdx'
PlayList.c:246: warning: format '%4d' expects type 'int', but argument 5
has type 'sIdx'
PlayList.c: In member function 'int cPlayList::LoadM3U(const char*)':
PlayList.c:647: error: invalid initialization of non-const reference of
type 'const char*&amp;' from a temporary of type 'const char*'
softplay.h:120: error: in passing argument 1 of 'void skipSpaces(const
char*&amp;)'
PlayList.c:674: error: invalid initialization of non-const reference of

&gt;<i>Thank you for packaging all the packages for debian (not only softdevice
</I>&gt;<i>and softplay, also for all the other packages)!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You're welcome! ;-)

&gt;<i>I still have a packaging related question. I'm not sure if you already
</I>&gt;<i>packaged the softdevice-0.2.2,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I've updated the package but haven't released it yet. (Wanted to do this
with softplay together.)

&gt;<i>So my question is now: the shmclient has to be linked against a few vdr
</I>&gt;<i>objects, is it possible to do that in a debian package?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's a little bit difficult. I can think of the following solutions:

1) The necessary VDR sources are put into the debian package - but this
makes the source package too dependent on the vdr version

2) The VDR package is modified, to produce a static library, containing
the needed objects, which is distributed with vdr-dev. That's probably
the cleanest solution, but I have to speak with Thomas first, because I
don't want the VDR package at e-tobi.net to be too different from the
official Debian package.

What's the reason for the SHMClient? Can't this be built directly into
the plugin? A separate 'launchshmclient' could then trigger the plugin
to start the SHMClient.

bye,

Tobias
