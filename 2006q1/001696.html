I installed the Debian package libc6-dbg and set
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/debug for the vdr process, but could not
reproduce this.  I was unable to reproduce this even with the default
libc6.  The CPU usage of libc was only about 4 percent.

First, this appeared to come from the OSD menu.  When viewing a program
that has subtitles, there will be much OSD activity, like this:

I just switched to a channel that does not display DVB subtitles to see
if the culprit really is the OSD, which would be displayed and hidden
every few seconds when viewing subtitles.  There was not much difference,
as cDFBVideoOut::YUV() is constantly invoking Flip().

I see that there is an option for triple buffering, but apparently only
for VGA.  Would it be possible to enable it for mgatv?  Could
matroxEngineSync() yield the CPU to another thread?  (Is the stream being
decoded in another thread?)  In DirectFB 0.9.23, which I'm using, it's
just burning CPU:

               :    2d30:       lea    0x1(%edx),%eax
               :    2d33:       mov    %eax,0x1c(%esi)
     1  0.0075 :    2d36:       mov    %eax,%edx
               :    2d38:       mov    0x1e14(%edi),%eax
 13280 99.0971 :    2d3e:       and    $0x30000,%eax
     1  0.0075 :    2d43:       cmp    %eax,%ecx
               :    2d45:       jne    2d30 &lt;matroxEngineSync+0x30&gt;

Here's the corresponding source code from gfxdrivers/matrox/mmio.h,
mga_waitidle():

     while ((mga_in32(mdrv-&gt;mmio_base, STATUS) &amp; (DWGENGSTS | ENDPRDMASTS)) !=
             mdev-&gt;idle_status) {
          mdev-&gt;idle_waitcycles++;
     }

I updated DirectFB and DFB++ to CVS HEAD (this code hasn't changed there)
and tried if caching the mmio_base and idle_status in registers and
removing the idle_waitcycles counter makes any difference.  No:

               :    2d10:       mov    (%edx),%eax
 13413 99.2820 :    2d12:       and    $0x30000,%eax
     1  0.0074 :    2d17:       cmp    %eax,%ecx
               :    2d19:       jne    2d10 &lt;matroxEngineSync+0x20&gt;

This loop is wasting 10% of all non-idle CPU (about 5% of total CPU)
on my system when using the YUY2 output format.  Can't the chip generate
an interrupt when it becomes idle?

There do not appear to be any Flip() calls when using I420 VGA output.

Here is a work-around: Sleep between the StretchBlit() and Flip() calls:

diff -p -u -r1.45 video-dfb.c
--- video-dfb.c 10 Jan 2006 19:40:25 -0000      1.45
+++ video-dfb.c 19 Jan 2006 23:04:04 -0000
@@ -1396,6 +1397,7 @@ void cDFBVideoOut::YUV(uint8_t *Py, uint
 #endif

       }
+      usleep(2000);
       //scrSurface-&gt;Flip(NULL, (setupStore-&gt;useMGAtv) ? DSFLIP_WAITFORSYNC:DSFLIP_ONSYNC);
       scrSurface-&gt;Flip(NULL, DSFLIP_WAITFORSYNC);

A usleep(5000) reduced the CPU usage of libdirectfb_matrox.so from over
15000 to 83 samples.  usleep(1000) increased the number of samples
to 109, with 14 samples in matroxEngineSync().  usleep(2000) resulted in
70 samples in libdirectfb_matrox.so, with 7 in matroxEngineSync().  Of
course, I should have sampled longer than 20 seconds to get more accurate
values.

I don't know what the optimal parameter for the usleep might be.  I guess
it depends on the value of HZ (which can be 100, 250, or 1000) and the
video frame rate, as the granularity of usleep() is 1/HZ seconds.  For
a 25 Hz frame rate (like mgatv), a frame takes 40 milliseconds.  At
HZ=100 (on 2.4 kernels), the sleep granularity is 10 milliseconds, which
might be too tight.  On VGA, it is even worse.  I guess that to be on the
safe side, you should put usleep(1000) there.  It doesn't make so much
difference if libdirectfb_matrox.so takes 0.1% or 0.06% of the CPU, but
10% (without any sleep) is definitely too much.

Later, I might see if something similar can be done in
cDFBVideoOut::OpenOSD(), cDFBVideoOut::RefreshOSD(),
cDFBVideoOut::CloseOSD(), and cDFBVideoOut::ShowOSD().
Any busy-waiting in RefreshOSD() might explain why audio and video frames
are occasionally dropped while the menus are being browsed.
