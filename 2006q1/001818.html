We had a discussion about this when softplay was started. Back than we
decided to have it separated, and I still favour this option for several
reasons.
Why exactly would you like to have a single tarball? Because of the
dependency on softdevice.h? This is not needed anymore from vdr-1.3.30
and a softplay cvs version from today. The communication between the
softdevice and softplay now happens over the service interface.

I would not completely exclude the possibility of integrating softplay
into the softdevice, but there would have to be a good reason for that
which I can understand.

Bye,
Martin
