It's an Epia MII-12000 with a Nehemiah processor. I'll test that system more 
later on. The CPU usage sits between ca. 65% and 85%, depending on the 
bitrate of the channel, so it isn't totally ideal! With the xine plugin and 
hardware MPEG2 decoding, it is down at about 35% (from memory) but the OSD 
wasn't as good (software blended, and really sluggish unless it was opaque), 
and that also requires the extra overhead of X running!

Don't get me wrong here: the OSD is still really good just not as responsive 
as on my other Matrox system! E.g. on the Matrox system, if I hold down the 
'down' key on a menu, the selection tracks down smoothly. On the epia system, 
the selection skips lines as it moves down, looking as if the OSD isn't 
updated as quickly, or something.

I've just noticed that MMX2 is enabled by default in softdevice; this CPU 
doesn't have this: not sure whether disabling that would make any difference 
but I'll give it a go!
