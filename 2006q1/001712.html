</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of Expose events, so I disabled map_count increment for this 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (new handled) event type.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Martin, in which situations did you encounter problems with old logic ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>
&gt;<i> I think it's stupid to randomly only to handle every third event, and

</I>&gt;<i> softdevice was/is broken.
</I>
No that's not stupid, it's just optimizing. Think of resizing. In that
situation you'll get ContigureNotify on every pixel size change
and a final Expose.

&gt;<i> For instance the OSD was redrawn every other
</I>&gt;<i> video frame and not just on OSD change or window format change.
</I>
Hm, could be part of logic from vdr-1.2.x. OSD (re)draw was quite
different from that now.

&gt;<i> The Expose events are send by the xlib in case the window has to be
</I>&gt;<i> redrawn, for example because the window was partly overdrawn by an other
</I>&gt;<i> window and is put in front again. So in principle one only has to draw
</I>&gt;<i> the OSD in Expose events and on OSD change.
</I>&gt;<i> But as far as I understand the XClearArea() usage in the softdevice is
</I>&gt;<i> mostly wrong, usually we use XClearArea() and then immediately redraw
</I>&gt;<i> the window. 
</I>
&gt;<i>This is wrong, because the XClearArea() call automatically
</I>&gt;<i> generates Expose events, so that the redrawing happens automatically
</I>&gt;<i> from ProcessEvents. And that is also the reason why XClearArea() should
</I>&gt;<i> not be called on Expose events.
</I>
Ah, thats why I never handled/looked at Expose events :-) .

&gt;<i> I'm still new to xlib programming, so I maybe wrong somewhere, but to my
</I>&gt;<i> experience now the cpu usage of the xlib is smaller when osd is shown.
</I>&gt;<i> And there are still a lot of things which could be cleaned up...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
[snip code]

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To fix your problem, isn't it enough to uncomment XvShmPutImage()?
</I>
No, when going from full to windowed mode, it is required to clear
the entire area. Assume displaying a 4:3 video in a 16:9 window.
Without clear(), there may some parts of a previous drawn OSD left
and right of the video area.
