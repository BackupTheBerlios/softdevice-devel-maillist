<PRE>Hi all,

Here's my update on the matter after upgrading quite everything. I would
like to thank those who replied to my questions.
First : I still have field parity problems with interlaced material on
interlaced TV.
Second : there are a lot things there, from the kernel, viafb,
libcle266mpegdec, DirectFB, DFB++, up to softdevice...


Kernel 2.6.17 Debian
* fresh compile and packaging

linux-viafb CVS 20061008 (today)
* applied viafb_flip_ioctl.patch from Mark Adams (transfered by Rolf
Ahrenberg and Laz today)
* this patch is really old, and does not apply totally cleanly on
today's CVS
* attached is un updated patch against current CVS (maybe Mark could
apply it to CVS if he have no better idea now about how to implement that ?)

libcle266mpegdec 0.4 (latest as of today) (oops : I didn't even try CVS)
* the GetFBOffset.patch isn't needed anymore with DirectFB 1.0rc1
* but GetFBOffsetDFB++.patch is still needed with DFB++ CVS
* maybe Rolf could get this patch integrated inside DFB++ before it
reaches 1.0rc stage ?

DirectFB 1.0rc1 (latest as of today)
* since GetFBOffset.patch is already applied, I only have to add
dfb_unichrome_flip_ioctl.patch from Mark Adams (transfered by Rolf
Ahrenberg and Laz today)
* here is the updated patch against 1.0rc1
* this patch was difficult to cleanly apply, because adjustments were
not correct (the code is so light and clean that patch select the wrong
function to apply a chunk, while the other was correctly placed)
(GetFBOffset.patch even applied cleanly, even though it was already in
place, and patch didn't see it)
* maybe Mark could add his patch to DirectFB CVS (if the freeze for 1.0
still allows that)
* to my knowledge, it is the only patch to apply to DirectFB
* see dfbinfo output attached (Caps: ... FIELD_PARITY ...)

DFB++ CVS 20061008 (today)
* applied the GetFBOffsetDFB++.patch from libcle266mpegdec
* this patch should make it into CVS, to keep in sync with DirectFB
* there is nothing about field parity there, since Mark's patch was
about the unichrome driver, not about DirectFB API (which DFB++ only
deals with)

softdevice CVS 20061008 (today)
* no patch to apply ?
* uses libclempegdec, viafb, etc.
* to attached log shows field parity is enabled ([softdevice] enabling
field parity / [softdevice] enabling CLE266 HW decoding)


I don't know what I miss to get rid of interlacing artifacts on TV out...


Nicolas Huillard a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> I'm a bit lost about what's needed for field parity correctness on
</I>&gt;<i> TV-out with CLE266. I still have field artifacts on interlaced streams
</I>&gt;<i> on TV-out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My setup :
</I>&gt;<i> VDR 1.4.2
</I>&gt;<i> softdevice CVS 20060929 (-P softdevice -ao alsa:pcm=default -vo
</I>&gt;<i> dfb:viatv:cle266)
</I>&gt;<i> libcle266mpegdec 0.4
</I>&gt;<i> DirectFB-2006-09-10-04-25-09-UTC
</I>&gt;<i> DFB++-2006-09-10-04-25-02-UTC
</I>&gt;<i> linux-viafb 20060910 (viafb mode=720x576 bpp=32 refresh=50 TVon=1
</I>&gt;<i> TVoverscan=1)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think I do not need any patches for linux-viafb (Mark Adams commited
</I>&gt;<i> his patches to CVS)
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know if I need something special in DirectFB/DFB++ (I applied
</I>&gt;<i> libcle266mpegdec-0.3/patches/GetFBOffset.patch)
</I>&gt;<i> I think the latest softdevice filed parity patches have joined CVS
</I>&gt;<i> before I checked it out.
