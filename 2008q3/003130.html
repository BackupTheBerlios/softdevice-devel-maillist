First impressions: will need proper testing &quot;in normal useage&quot;!

Cut marks do now get set pretty much where I press 0.

Fast forward (multispeed enabled): as I increase the fast-forward speed, the 
time counter stays running forward at the same speed but the pictures shown 
speed up with each increase. It looks like the counter is always going at the 
maximum speed but the pictures shown do increase in speed form 2x to the 
maximum (can't remember what that is!).

I still lose A-V synch after slow motion.

I'm pretty sure it does the same whether I have av_read_frame or not.

I wouldn't be surprised if this was down to ffmpeg versions because its 
behaviour seems to change quite regularly between versions! Any experience of 
current svn? What configure options are you using when building it?

I had a similar setup (DirectFB, G450) which I used on-and-off for several 
years and I remember that the A-V synch was pretty rock solid on that.

&gt;<i> &gt; 2nd Feature makes field selectable which is displayed in still picture
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     mode, but unfortunately this doesn't work at the moment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Excellent: I had toyed with the idea of implementing that in the past but 
never got anywhere! I take it that this will remove flicker from a paused 
interlaced stream?

Cheers,

Laz
