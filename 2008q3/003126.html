I've been seeing the same thing since back in May with DirectFB / Matrox G450 
output with softdevice (see thread &quot;Trickspeed jumps huge distances...&quot; back 
in May). This was a newly built system but I've not had this problem before 
with the same type of hardware.

My initial suspicions were that it had to do with the virtual function
cDevice::HasIBPTrickSpeed which was introduced in vdr 1.5.15. However, I've 
played about enabling and disabling that in softdevice but get the same 
outcome as you describe.

I also see poor A-V synch after using fast or slow speeds: this can be 
corrected by jumping backwards or forwards! I think there is a limit to the 
A-V offset so that if the offset is greater than that value it is set to 
zero: I'm pretty sure this is connected with the &quot;position&quot; in the file and 
the current frames being shown being so far apart after using a fast or slow 
speed.

If I jump forward or backwards by a minute, the actual position jumped (as 
shown by the counter) is something like 1:12 forwards and 50 s backwards, 
rather than a minute as it should be. Also, when setting a cut mark, the 
position jumps forward quite a few I-frames, rather than just to the next 
one.

I'm pretty sure that all of these are connected but whether it's down to 
changes in vdr or in softdevice...

Any clues?

Cheers,

Laz
