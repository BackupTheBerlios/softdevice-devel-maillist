</I>
Just checked and it's ffmpeg svn from 29/07/08 (happy to check out a new 
version, if you think that would help!). I'm pretty sure I had the same 
issues with svn from 24/04/08: I think I upgraded it to see if it fixed the 
problem!

:<i>-)
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; My initial suspicions were that it had to do with the virtual function
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cDevice::HasIBPTrickSpeed which was introduced in vdr 1.5.15. However,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've played about enabling and disabling that in softdevice but get the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same outcome as you describe.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I also see poor A-V synch after using fast or slow speeds: this can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; corrected by jumping backwards or forwards! I think there is a limit to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the A-V offset so that if the offset is greater than that value it is set
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to zero: I'm pretty sure this is connected with the &quot;position&quot; in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; file and the current frames being shown being so far apart after using a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fast or slow speed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For sync issues, you may use attached patch, see below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If I jump forward or backwards by a minute, the actual position jumped
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (as shown by the counter) is something like 1:12 forwards and 50 s
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; backwards, rather than a minute as it should be. Also, when setting a cut
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mark, the position jumps forward quite a few I-frames, rather than just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the next one.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm pretty sure that all of these are connected but whether it's down to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; changes in vdr or in softdevice...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any clues?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you both try attached patch ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are 2 changes:
</I>&gt;<i> 1st Makes use of av_read_frame() selectable via OSD.
</I>&gt;<i>     Thats because I noticed some serrious sync issues with my old ffmpeg
</I>&gt;<i>     version I use on my prod system. Deactivating av_read_frame() and
</I>&gt;<i>     using av_read_packed() instead solved that for me.
</I>&gt;<i> 2nd Feature makes field selectable which is displayed in still picture
</I>&gt;<i>     mode, but unfortunately this doesn't work at the moment.
</I>
Will try patch and get back with the results ASAP...

Cheers,

Laz
