<PRE>Stefan Lucke a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> I guess the source of your problem is in the unichrome-directfb.diff from
</I>&gt;<i> Mark Adams 2005-09-07 on directfb-user list (if you are using that).
</I>&gt;<i> Won't say that it is faulty or wrong, but from reading I guess it does
</I>&gt;<i> wait always for frame change to happen.
</I>
Mark doesn't use softdevice, so it might be that softdevice and that
patch do not agree on something.

&gt;<i> Other applications have a separate thread, which does only the flip.
</I>&gt;<i> So they are not affected by that change. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If someone has the spec sheet for the epia video chip, he should sent
</I>&gt;<i> me that via private mail.
</I>
I have the specs of the VT1622 and VT1622a TV encoders, which are
separate from the CLE266. I didn't find specs of the CLE266, apart from
a PDF describing the setup of the Windows drivers.

&gt;<i> I can't believe that this chip has no possibility to report current field.
</I>
I can be understood :
* the CLE266 emits both a digital signal and a VGA output, based on the
same timings
* the TV encoder converts that digital signal to a PAL signal
* when you use both TV and VGA screen, you see 50Hz non-interlaced on
the VGA, and proper PAL on the TV
* thus the CLE266 emits 50Hz full frame non-interlaced
* and the TV encoder drop one field on each frame, alternatively : first
frame, transmit only even lines to the TV / next frame, transmit only
odd lines to the TV
* the TV encoder is only synchronized with the CLE266 on this digital
signal, but does not return field information
* it can only be programmed using I2C, and I didn't see any IRQ line
getting out of the chip

I don't even know how Mark can report proper field, except by counting
each and every frame out from the CLE266, and making sure the TV encoder
starts with the right field upon setup. Any frame miss will lead to the
wrong field identification, until the next frame miss...

&gt;<i> A real problem for me is that, I don't get any sound out of my epia board.
</I>&gt;<i> Would be nice if some could help with a working asound.state for such a
</I>&gt;<i> board or required module parms for via82xx. I tried ac97_quirk=[0,1]
</I>&gt;<i> but that made no difference.
</I>
Please see mine attached. I didn't ever edited that file and don't even
know what it contains. I got it from /var/lib/alsa/asound.state on my
EPIA M10k, Debian sarge with an old history. It worked from the beginning.
