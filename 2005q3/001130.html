How can one request the different play modes?  I just surfed the setup
menus of vdr 1.3.27 and didn't notice anything relevant.

</I>
Well, I guess the patch simply wouldn't suspend live playback on FF
cards.  It shouldn't break anything; it'd just make the user experience
a bit inconsistent.  I don't have high hopes of getting the patch
accepted to VDR, but we'll see.

&gt;<i> But I don't know how to switch off the non-transfer mode for FF card,
</I>&gt;<i> however I guess it should not be difficult.
</I>
I wouldn't be too sure about that.  It depends on how the proprietary
firmware of the cards has been written.
