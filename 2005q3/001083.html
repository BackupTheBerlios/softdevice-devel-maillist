Based on a quick Google search and a look at the DFB++ source code,
it seems that the exception object indeed needs to be freed.

DFB++ appears to be a wrapper over DirectFB that maps nonzero
values to exceptions.  I'd rather use the DirectFB C interface
and perhaps add __attribute__((warn_unused_result)) to the
functions.  However, when used properly, exceptions can make
the code more readable (no &quot;if this fails, do that&quot; clutter).

&gt;<i> It looks like all DirectFB operations should be governed by catch
</I>&gt;<i> statements.  Is someone working on video-dfb.c right now?  If not,
</I>&gt;<i> I may give this a try.
</I>
Oh well, I decided that it is not too much work.  I hope
I caught all cases (I have a stripped-down system on my VDR
box, and I edited the file with vi).

I think that the code could be simplified further.  There
are several try-catch blocks in the SetParams method, because
I was not sure if some of the errors can be ignored.

While writing the patch, I also fixed some formatting things.
It found two indentation styles and tried to follow the one
that seemed more frequent.  But I didn't at first notice that
variable declarations are indented by one extra level.

I also corrected a few spelling mistakes in output messages
and replaced the only non-ASCII character in the file with
the string &quot;micro&quot;.  (I think that latin1 characters should
be avoided in output messages, because UTF-8 is becoming
more and more common.)

Please apply this patch, as it greatly increases the stability
of softdevice and makes it possible to use text console
on top of the vdr screen (which is very useful if you want
to check something quickly on the box while watching TV).

I tested the patch by leaning on the OK key on my RCU
(which causes the cx88 driver to generate keypress events
several times per second) while flipping virtual consoles
with Alt-F1 through Alt-F6 and by cat'ing a 25,000-line text
file to console while a show with subtitles was running.
Both acts would crash softdevice immediately without this
patch.
