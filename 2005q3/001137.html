I'm using the 'patcher2k' version of viafb (with some enhancements for
interlace) and can use double buffering or triple buffering in
DirectFB with no problems.

</I>
I believe my setup has the CLE266 generating a 720x576/50 Hz
progressive picture with 27 MHz clock (28 will give you incorrect
horizontal scaling but shouldn't cause the problems you describe). 
The VT1622A (in my case) is then programmed with suitable PLL settings
to sync to this picture and generate the 625 line PAL picture. 
Scaling and filtering is turned off in the VT1622A.

I think you're probably right that the VT1622/1622A does not have a
frame buffer but it must have a buffer of a few lines in order to do
the filtering and scaling.

&gt;<i> What I have with various sort of CRTC timing is a &quot;out-of-range scan&quot; on
</I>&gt;<i> the VGA monitor (thus black screen), and a totally disturbed &quot;image&quot; on
</I>&gt;<i> the TV (when it does not blank the screen the same way the monitor does).
</I>
Many VGA monitors will not like the 50 Hz frame rate (and maybe not
the 31.25 kHz line rate either).  I've mainly been using flat panel
displays: some of them are happy, some are not.

You should get a nice picture on the TV screen though.  Is the TV
locked but the image disturbed (and possibly
scrolling/flickering/sheared/duplicated) or is it unlocked (if you're
ears are young enough, you'd hear a different tone from the TV than
when it was getting a good signal)?  If the latter, your configuration
of the TV chip must be incorrect for the picture that the CLE266 is
putting out such that the TV chip can't generate a valid signal.  If
the former, your problem is more likely to be in the CLE266 or the
input-side parameters of the VT1622.

&gt;<i> I'm nearly giving-up... Any advice regarding CRTC registers, docs about
</I>&gt;<i> them, different variant of chips in the VIA Unichrome line, is welcome.
</I>
Try posting the output from the vt1622 utility from the unichrome
project when you type 'D' and I'll see if I can spot anything obvious.

Regards,

Mark
