Very interesting. I've seen this on my box too, but before trying out
any changes in dvbplayer.c. I've come to believe it's a hardware fault
in my pci bridge, since the fan on it went bust a few weeks ago, and I
didn't notice until recently. I've tried different kernels, different
dvb-t cards, but not different vdr versions. 

I might have to try downgrading. It's very weird, as when it happens,
everything goes really slowly, even X cannot refresh its display.
