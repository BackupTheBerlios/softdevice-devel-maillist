Nope, but I have disabled CMDDEB if that makes a difference.  Here's
the output from the log after a couple of f.fwd and rewind.  The last
one lead to the crash:

(no newline at the end of the '+++' line)

Yes, I recall that suggestion from a few weeks ago, and I think that the
modification made the crashes go away earlier.  However, I recall there
were other problems the last time I tried it.  I think I'll have to keep
using that setting longer now.  It seems to make the crash go away.

Is there a reason why this cannot be made the default?  Does DirectFB
define any version symbol that could be checked with ifdef?

It looks like softdevice won't always detect aspect ratio changes during
rewind.  It'll display 4:3 footage as 16:9, even after pressing Stop and Play.
Skipping stream in 1-minute steps sometimes makes it detect the correct aspect
ratio, but only if the skipping will switch from 4:3 to 16:9 and back.
Isn't the aspect ratio setting included in every GOP?
