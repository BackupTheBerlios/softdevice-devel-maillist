It's true that audio and video only modes are present in the softdevice,
 but they are a corrupted. The reason is exactly the &quot;XXX hack&quot; parts,
we need this since vdr sends, when sending only video I-Frames for
StillPicture or TrickSpeed mode, sometimes audio junk. So the hack is to
turn off audio playback while displaying a StillPicture or in trickspeed
mode.
The drawback of this hack is that if you've requested video only, you
will get audio after a still picture or trickspeed mode. Up to now noone
complained about that...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, I think that the VDR &quot;suspended&quot; flag would have to be
</I>&gt;<i> examined in cDevice::PlayPesPacket().  I believe that it is best to
</I>&gt;<i> make the flag independent of the play mode, like the softdevice
</I>&gt;<i> suspended flag currently is.
</I>
This would only work in transfer and replay mode. I'm not sure about
this since I don't own a FF card, but as far as I know FF cards usually
don't use transfer mode while watching TV. So in case you want to ask
Klaus to introduce the patch into mainline vdr I guess you have to do it
differently, or take extra care of the FF cards.
But I don't know how to switch off the non-transfer mode for FF card,
however I guess it should not be difficult.
