Don't you even see increased CPU usage when playing back recordings?
Luckily, I don't have jerky playback (unless using Matrox tv-out, which
consumes way more CPU than VGA for some reason).  I made two simple
profiling runs on NPTL and vdr 1.3.27, subtitles 0.3.7 and current
softdevice with the following settings:

CropMode: 4:3
Deinterlace: none
Postprocess: none
Buffer Mode: good seeking
Pixel Format: I420

In the live playback run, I recorded the stream.  Here's the top of
opreport --global-percent:

  samples|      %|
------------------
   151565 57.0991 libvdr-softdevice.so.1.3.27
    52674 19.8439 libc-2.3.2.so
    27401 10.3228 vmlinux
     8782  3.3084 oprofiled
     8427  3.1747 vdr

Here's the output when playing back.  This should be less work, as
there's less I/O (no I/O from the DVB tuner).  Alas, the CPU usage
is higher:

  samples|      %|
------------------
   170194 51.5064 libvdr-softdevice.so.1.3.27
    43782 13.2499 libc-2.3.2.so
    38975 11.7951 vdr
    31644  9.5765 libpthread-0.60.so
    20935  6.3356 vmlinux
    11247  3.4037 oprofiled

In softdevice, the top of opreport -l looks as follows for live
playback:

samples  %        symbol name
17392    11.4749  put_pixels16_mmx
15957    10.5282  put_pixels8_mmx

8300      5.4762  ff_mpa_synth_filter
6107      4.0293  mpeg2_decode_block_non_intra
5718      3.7726  MPV_decode_mb
5173      3.4131  mpeg2_decode_block_intra
5017      3.3101  put_pixels16_y2_mmx2
4760      3.1406  ff_simple_idct_put_mmx
4326      2.8542  avg_pixels8_mmx2
4258      2.8094  MPV_motion
3993      2.6345  mpeg_decode_motion
... (lots of symbols that appear to be in ffmpeg)
654       0.4315  mpeg_decode_frame
615       0.4058  avg_pixels8_xy2_mmx2
599       0.3952  put_pixels_clamped_mmx
507       0.3345  cDFBVideoOut::YUV(unsigned char*, unsigned char*,
unsigned char*, int, int, int, int)
378       0.2494  ff_er_add_slice
341       0.2250  cVideoOut::Draw(cBitmap*, unsigned char*, int, bool)
252       0.1663  ScaleBitmap(cBitmap*, int&amp;, int&amp;, int&amp;, int&amp;, int,
int, int, int)
186       0.1227  ff_init_block_index
149       0.0983  cVideoStreamDecoder::DecodePacket(AVPacket*)
134       0.0884  MPV_frame_start

In &quot;dead&quot; playback, the list looks roughly the same, except for the
method at top:

samples  %        symbol name
22284    13.0933  cStreamDecoder::BufferFill()
16221     9.5309  put_pixels16_mmx
15273     8.9739  put_pixels8_mmx
9733      5.7188  put_pixels16_xy2_mmx
8515      5.0031  ff_simple_idct_add_mmx
7917      4.6518  mpeg_decode_mb
7674      4.5090  ff_mpa_synth_filter
5949      3.4954  mpeg2_decode_block_non_intra
5487      3.2240  MPV_decode_mb
4774      2.8050  mpeg2_decode_block_intra
4771      2.8033  put_pixels16_y2_mmx2
4376      2.5712  ff_simple_idct_put_mmx
4018      2.3608  MPV_motion

In live playback, the method cStreamDecoder::BufferFill() got only
16 samples (0.0106 % of softdevice execution time).  In the output of
&quot;opannotate -t 13 -a --source .../libvdr-softdevice-1.3.27&quot;, there
are two weird-looking instructions that seem to consume a lot of time.
Or maybe it's the preceding idiv that is consuming the time:

   187  0.1099 :   656d3:       idiv   %ecx
  9485  5.5731 :   656d5:       lea    (%edx,%edx,4),%edx
   302  0.1774 :   656d8:       lea    (%edx,%edx,4),%edx
   289  0.1698 :   656db:       lea    0x0(,%edx,4),%eax

This is after the call to Available():
               :    inline int Available()
	       :    { return (LastPacket+MaxPackets - FirstPacket)%MaxPackets; }

The &quot;+MaxPackets&quot; is redundant, isn't it?  (Unless LastPacket&lt;FirstPacket,
of course.)

But I guess the real reason why this takes so much time is that the
BufferFill method is being called too often.  It looks like it's only
called from cSoftDevice::Poll().  Unfortunately I can't see the caller
of that method without linking vdr and softdevice statically (or maybe
I can, but I haven't figured out how).

After I applied the patch you posted later (Sleep=true in dvbplayer.c),
this problem went away.  The samples reported for live and recorded
playback are comparable - in fact, the system appears to be consuming
slightly less CPU when playing back recorded streams.  Good work, Martin!

BTW, any chance of introducing the &quot;suspended&quot; flag to vdr itself?
That'd go with some auto-power-off logic, i.e., if suspended=true
and vdr is currently recording, turn power off after the recording
is completed (after some short timeout).  That'd make vdr much easier
to use for my wife.  (We're recording children's programs daily, and
she leaves the computer on, because she won't retry if the timed
recording is still going on at the time she tries to power the
system off.)

Should there perhaps be a bug reporting system or a list of known
bugs on the web page?  I have reported two bugs earlier that still
appear to be there with vdr-1.3.27 and current softdevice CVS.
First, the Power key is ignored when playing back recordings.
Second, vdr crashes with Signal 11 when selecting &quot;Restart&quot; (sp?,
my OSD is in Finnish).
