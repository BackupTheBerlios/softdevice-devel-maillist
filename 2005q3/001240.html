It really is quite reliable already.  The vdr box is our only TV
receiver and recorder in our household since about 6 months.  I
wonder why I started getting these crashes now.  Maybe it's just
pure coincidence, like the recent aviation accidents.  Now that
you fixed the bug that affected my vdr-suspend patch, I'm completely
happy with the performance of softdevice again.  I don't believe
that proprietary DVB set-top boxes are any better, even the high-end
ones.

Have you tried LD_PRELOAD=libefence.so.0 (Electric Fence)?  My box only
runs at 900 MHz and it only has 256 MB of RAM, so I'm afraid it would
be too tight (it'd only run a few seconds).

&gt;<i> Is there a caught exception message like:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;[dfb] YUV: action=%s, result=%s\n&quot;
</I>
No.

&gt;<i> The messages just before the crash happend, would be interesting.

(!) [  809:    0.000] --&gt; Caught signal 11 (at 0x2e7ffe0, invalid address) &lt;--

The (re)configuring/(re)configured messages were displayed from stderr
line 122 to 2535, occasionally interleaved with &quot;Could not open /dev/rtc&quot;.

It would be helpful to have time stamps in the output.  Maybe the
messages were logged in a burst, or maybe over a long time; I hope
you have some ideas.  Before these lines, the following lines were
repeated from line 86 to line 121:

Could not open /dev/rtc
[softdevice] allocating picture buffer for resolution 704x576 format 0
[softdevice] picture buffer released

Here's a snip from immediately before that:

Could not open /dev/rtc
[softdevice] allocating picture buffer for resolution 704x576 format 0
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++[softdevice] picture buffer released
Could not open /dev/rtc

I hope you can make sense out of this.
