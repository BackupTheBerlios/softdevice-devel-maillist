</I>
Will it be using these nan values for the timing or is it just for the
printing?

&gt;<i> However I think that the nans you see are just because I was a bit lazy

</I>
I'll add a few more '.0' bits and see if it makes any difference. I
could see the /1000 giving an int and rounding errors but not nan!
Looking at mpeg2decoder.c, these are only used in the printfs so it
can't affect the actual behaviour.

&gt;<i> About the source of the bad A-V sync I'm not sure... As far as I
</I>&gt;<i> remember DireftFB out tries to sync to the refreshrate of the TV. Are
</I>&gt;<i> you using a TV for output? What is the refreshrate of the videomode?
</I>&gt;<i> Could you please check if you see a line
</I>&gt;<i> [dfb] Display frame time is XXX microseconds
</I>&gt;<i> on the stdout and report that time?
</I>
I have both a (PAL) TV and monitor attached. Both are running at 50 Hz
(TV because it's PAL, and monitor reports as such on it's OSD). The
output shows:

[dfb] Display frame time is 19994 microseconds

which I work out to be 50 Hz.

The A-V sync is correct for some of the time but it does wander a lot.
Let me know if there are any things I can do to try to track down the
source of the problem.

How good is A-V sync on unichrome with directfb output when it hasn't
been patched for field-sync? Looking through the list archives, most of
the development seems to be done on Matrox cards. Is unichrome output
known to be less good at present because not many people are using /
testing it?

Cheers,

Laz
