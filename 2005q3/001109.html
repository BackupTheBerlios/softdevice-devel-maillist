</I>I just had a look at what I did back then. Actually it should not be too
difficult to take the changes back, you just need a pointer to the
AudioDecoder in the VideoDecoder.
Maybe you can just introduce a static variable for the pointer, but make
sure to set it to NULL in the AudioDecoder destructor and check for not
NULL before you dereference it ( the AudioDecoder is deleted everytime
the channel is changed).
If you have the pointer you just need to replace
 uint64_t aPTS = clock-&gt;GetPTS();
with the call to cAudioDecoder::GetPTS()

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>So far, this bug was confirmed by another DirectFB and Matrox G[45][50]0
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>user.  What about DirectFB users having other than Matrox cards?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, could it be that Xv output is not double or triple buffered?
</I>&gt;<i> I saw a comment that said that the A-V delay is best computed after
</I>&gt;<i> displaying the frame.  Does that refer to the cathode ray actually
</I>&gt;<i> drawing the last visible line on the screen, or to blitting the bitmap
</I>&gt;<i> to the screen memory?  If the latter and if Xv doesn't have any double
</I>&gt;<i> buffering or synchronization to the output video signal, this could
</I>&gt;<i> well be the reason why A-V sync has gone bad on DirectFB.  (I have the
</I>&gt;<i> impression that DirectFB does double or triple buffering.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Hmm, I don't know for shure, but I think double or tripple buffering
should not affect the A-V sync.

&gt;<i> One more thing: would it be helpful to enable MPGDEB in mpeg2decoder.c
</I>&gt;<i> and send you the output?  Is it normal to have audio pts offset floating
</I>&gt;<i> around 0x80000000?  Examples: -2454882835, -2454882862, -2454882889.
</I>I guess that's it. For me the offset changes only slowly in time and
only at the last digit. Can you please send me the debug output produced
be the attached patch?

Thanks,
Martin
