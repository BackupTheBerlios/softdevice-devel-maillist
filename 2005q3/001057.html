<PRE>Martin,

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;It seems that in the past few weeks, something in softdevice has changed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;so that audio lags behind by a couple of video frames.  I have a feeling
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;that an earlier CVS snapshot is performing better, but I'm not sure, since
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;the error is so subtle.  Has anyone else noticed problems with AV sync
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;lately?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was able to compensate this by setting AV delay to 2 or 3.  Has some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; internal delay been introduced lately?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, not on purpose. I changed the way the audio delay is accessed.
</I>&gt;<i> Prevously it was a call to the audio out, now just a offset to the
</I>&gt;<i> system clock is stored. The call to audio out was a bit unpredictable
</I>&gt;<i> since the call was from the video thread while the audio thread has been
</I>&gt;<i> running at the same time, so we got a few threading problems.
</I>
Thank you for confirming this.  For me, the delay seems unpredictable
now.  Or perhaps my eye is just not trained enough to see how many
video frames the audio is ahead or behind.  Maybe I should record some
soap opera junk like The Bold and the Beautiful.  Then I'd have enough
lip-synced material.

&gt;<i> Your not the first one to report this, I think Patrick Boetcher also
</I>&gt;<i> reported it. I already looked for mistakes in that change but up to now
</I>&gt;<i> everything looks ok :-/
</I>
Patrick, are you using DirectFB output?

Martin, can you post the change you made in diff -u format?

	Marko
