<PRE>Hi,

the last release is more than two months old. In the past few
days, there has been a new feature &quot;cropping&quot; (thanks to Vadim).
So I'd like to release a new version (0.2.0) soon. Hopefully cvs
version get's a bit more tests.

As there are only a few people subscribed to cvs commit list, I want
to offer the last changes (since 0.1.2) from CHANGELOG here too:

2005-07-23:
    - vidix-out:
      - some cosmetic cleanups
      - force OSD mode pseudo when YUY2 pixelformat is choosen
2005-07-22:
    - changed pause OSD handling in software drawing mode
    - work around for some *.avi files where frametime is zero
    - fix previously introduced compile fail without -DUSE_SUBPLUGINS
    - include patch from Claas Hilbrecht for &quot;-vo dummy:&quot;
    - some code reorg for subpluging loader
2005-07-20:
    - fix for live view at trick speed
    - stretchBlit mode for dfb-out is selectable via OSD
    - cropLeft/Right for xv-out and dfb-out
    - exclude cropTop/Bottom OSD from fb-out
    - adjusted vidix-out call of yv12_to_yuy2() to dfb-out
2005-07-17:
    - crop Top/Bottom for xv-out
    - introduce colour space conversion (by Malcom Caldwell)
    - make filters work with YUV422 color space
2005-07-16:
    - fix for cropBottom in dfb with YUY2 pixelformat
    - some preparations for configure in video-dfb.c
    - some preparations for configure in utils.c
2005-07-15:
    - by Vadim Catana:
      - fixed a couple of compiler warnings for gcc4 on x86-64
      - the video-vidix.c and video-dfb.c both contain code
        that converts pictures from YV12 format to YUY2. I moved
        this common code to a function in utils.c .
      - Some channels display white dots at the top and bottom of
        the screen due to WSS data encoded in the picture.
        This problem has been mentioned on vdr, linux-dvb and
        dxr3 mailinglists a few times. I added two new items in
        the softdevice menu that allow to cut off a number of lines
        from top and bottom of the picture. It is implemented now
        only for -vo vidix and dfb with i420/YV12 format and hardware
        alpha blending.
    - by Malcolm Caldwell: fix for vdr segfaulting
2005-07-03:
    - fix fullscreen mode for 64-bit architectures
    - improve response time for 60-sec skips
2005-06-30:
    - changed delay clamping low limit and printout &quot;+&quot; if we drop frames
    - dfb: report current frame duration
    - dfb: activated device specific delay handling
2005-06-28:
    - fix for loosing window dimensions upon switching from fullscreen mode to windowed mode
2005-06-26:
    - fix compile issue with recent gcc versions (patch by alexw)
2005-06-18:
    - provide error message on stderr when Xv plugin cannot connect to X server.
2005-06-12:
    - no new audio frame has been decoded when audio_size &lt;= 0
       (reported by Antonio O.)
    - introduce fast_memcpy (gives 20-30% speed increase on copying)
    - switch xv-out to fast_memcpy
    - enable fast and default deblock postprocessing
    - make buffersizes choosable
2005-06-06:
    - fixed latest ffmpeg cvs compile issue
    - applied fix for noisy audio on some soundcards (by Antonio O.)
    - applied GetDeviceDescription() patch for video-dfb.c (by Lucian Muresan)
2005-06-05:
    - compile by default with &quot;-g&quot;
    - fix vidix segfault
2005-05-29:
    - changed screen aspect ratio selection (based on suggestion by Nicolas Huillard)
    - fix some segfaults on bad signal
    - fix possible segfault when called without arguments 
      (thanks to Marko M&#228;kel&#228;)
    - buffering is now complety signal triggered
    - made buffersizes variable
