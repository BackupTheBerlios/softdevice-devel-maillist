You've convinced me.

Alas, it looks like making cDevice::PlayPesPacket() simply return
Length when playback is suspended won't cut it.  If I make the
method return 0 when suspended, it seems to cause a busy loop.

Playback will be suspended in both cases, but I believe that
the decoder should be reset when suspending (or resuming)
playback.  Now, at resume it'll take some time until the
decoder has re-synchronized on the stream.  Also, the screen
should be blanked immediately at suspend.  Are there some
methods for resetting the decoder and blanking the screen?

One more thing: the stream reader won't be suspended.  It'd be
nice if the DVB tuner were shut down during suspend, or if
the suspend key could be used as a &quot;pause&quot; key while playing
back recordings.  I think that the latter could be achieved by
catching the kSuspend key in menu.c and by making it work like
kPause or kPlay after flipping the flag.  However, I have to
figure out how to avoid a conflict between vdr.c and menu.c
reading this key.

Given that I'm such a novice when it comes to the VDR code base,
I think it's best I'll post the patch here first and wait for
some comments before presenting it on the main VDR list.  But
I'm not there yet.  Can you give me a few hints?

	Marko
