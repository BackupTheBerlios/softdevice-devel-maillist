<PRE>&gt;<i> This patch is simply a side-effect of my researches for perfect 720x576
</I>&gt;<i> (I first tried with this driver because it has 3 modes : overscan,
</I>&gt;<i> undersan and fit-to-screen, which should have been quite noscale, but in
</I>&gt;<i> fact isn't).
</I>
That got me interested too when I saw it but reading the documentation
it was clear that what they called 'fit-to-screen' was not what I
would have called 'fit-to-screen'!

&gt;<i> I got the 28Mhz figure from the VT1622 spec sheet, found by Googling (I
</I>&gt;<i> can provide the PDF if needed).
</I>
I haven't seen that (have got it now though).  I'd found details of
the VT1621 but not the 1622.  Broadcast digital TV and DVDs are,
however, most definitely sampled at 27 MHz and it seems to me that a
28 MHz dot clock will give a horizontal squeeze to the picture (but
nothing worse).

&gt;<i> You also sent me an fb.modes section stating 28Mhz. fbset -s currently
</I>&gt;<i> report the following (with the patcher2k driver) :
</I>
True but little of the information in fb.modes is used when TVout is
enabled: the timings all come from the TVout tables and are looked up
by the resolution (and the broadcast flag from fb.modes).

&gt;<i> &gt; Try posting the output from the vt1622 utility from the unichrome
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project when you type 'D' and I'll see if I can spot anything obvious.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll do. Thanks.
</I>
What you could also do is make yourself some kind of test card and
take a few pics of the result.  Something like a maximum sized diamond
would be good so you can see how much of the picture you're missing at
either side and top and bottom and whether there's any scaling going
on.

Regards,

Mark
