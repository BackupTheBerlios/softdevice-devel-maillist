Search for the mailing list archive for SIGABRT (that's what signal 6 is
on GNU/Linux).  I reported that a few months ago.  If I remember correctly,
it was a permissions problem.  Try to run as root, or try adding
no-vt-switch, no-vt-switching, and perhaps other options to your /etc/directfbrc.
You could also try building vdr.o with make NO_KBD=1.

&gt;<i> LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1 /usr/bin/vdr -v /var/lib/video.00 -c /var/lib/vdr
</I>&gt;<i> -L /usr/lib/vdr/plugins -r
</I>
Try adding &quot;strace&quot; before /usr/bin/vdr.  Then you should get an idea where it
fails.

By the way, under kernel 2.6.12.3 and DirectFB 0.9.22, vdr-softdevice works
pretty nicely, apart from the fact that I had to add a few infrared key
mappings for the new Hauppauge Nova-T PCI 90002 RCU to the kernel and to
the DirectFB.  (These mappings should now be in the development trees.)
There were far more glitches in 2.6.8 or maybe even 2.6.11.6.

I'm able to use virtual consoles while softdevice is running.  Apparently,
the consoles share the display layer with the OSD (at least on my
Matrox G450).  If I want to hide the text of the virtual consoles, I just
switch back to the virtual console &quot;owned&quot; by VDR and trigger OSD output.

If I'm on a different virtual console than where VDR was started from,
VDR occasionally crashes when trying to update the OSD.  I haven't tracked
this down, because for some reason, my system doesn't usually create core
dumps despite ulimit -c unlimited.  This would be nice to fix, because
the subtitles plugin initiates OSD events regularly.  In order to be able
to use the screen as a terminal without crashing VDR, I have to first
switch to a channel that won't display subtitles.  Suspending softdevice
won't help, because subtitles will be displayed independent of softdevice's
MPEG decoder.
