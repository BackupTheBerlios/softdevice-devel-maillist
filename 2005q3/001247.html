<PRE>To those who are not subscribers of the vdr mailing list,
I am proud to announce the vdr-suspend patch
(tested with 1.3.30, 1.3.31 and 1.3.32) and the vdr-relay plugin
(which requires the vdr-suspend patch).

The vdr-suspend patch allows the Power button to toggle a
&quot;Suspended&quot; flag.  When the flag is set, the MPEG PES streams
to anything else than recorder functions will be stopped.

This is better than the softdevice suspend flag, for two reasons:
First, if you are watching a recording, the playback will
effectively be paused during the suspension.  On softdevice suspend,
VDR would fast-forward the recording.  Second, users of the
vdr-subtitles plugin will be happy to notice that the subtitles
will not keep playing during the suspension.

When the Power button is pressed to suspend playback, a user-selectable
timeout can kick in.  If no button is pressed during this timeout,
vdr will shut down (unless, of course, timed recordings are running
or about to start; then, vdr would shut down after completing the
recordings).

With the vdr-relay plugin controlling an easy-to-build solid-state
relay box, you can power off the speakers and monitor when playback
is suspended.  On my system, the monitor and speakers will only be
powered on when the computer is started by remote control; for instance,
if it is started by nvram-wakeup for timed recordings, the equipment
will remain powered off.

Read more at <A HREF="http://www.funet.fi/~msmakela/software/vdr/">http://www.funet.fi/~msmakela/software/vdr/</A>
and get the most recent packages:
<A HREF="http://www.funet.fi/~msmakela/software/vdr/vdr-1.3.32-suspend-0.4.1.patch.gz">http://www.funet.fi/~msmakela/software/vdr/vdr-1.3.32-suspend-0.4.1.patch.gz</A>
<A HREF="http://www.funet.fi/~msmakela/software/vdr/vdr-relay-0.0.1.tgz">http://www.funet.fi/~msmakela/software/vdr/vdr-relay-0.0.1.tgz</A>

Note that you will have to configure the added variables in the
Setup/Miscellanous menu in order to enable the
&quot;resume/suspend/smart-power-off&quot; behaviour of the Power button.

Translation strings for the Setup/Miscellanous menu (file i18n.c in
vdr-1.3.32-suspend-0.4.1.patch.gz) are appreciated.  I could perhaps
come up with some more or less broken strings for Swedish and Estonian
and give Babelfish a try for further languages, but I think it's better
left to native speakers.  I hope that the German strings are not too broken.

	Marko
