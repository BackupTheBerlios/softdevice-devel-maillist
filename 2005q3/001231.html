<PRE>It seems that the crash bug that disturbs the use of my
vdr-suspend patch can also be triggered by skipping a
88-minute 16:9 recording in 1-minute steps at 33 ms
keyrepeat rate.  (After some kernel hacking last night,
I found out that ir-common.ko uses the default input.ko
keyrepeat timer instead of mapping RC5 frames (which are
sent every 177 ms) to keyrepeat events.)

If I press OK to activate the timestamp display on the
&quot;classic vdr&quot; theme and then keep the Yellow or Green key
pressed down while watching this particular 16:9 recording,
softdevice will often crash.

First time, I didn't get a stack trace, but the second
time I got one.  Third time, I wasn't able to repeat.
Interestingly, after some 5 or 10 seconds of skipping
going on at the 33 ms keyrepeat rate, softdevice would
only play audio frames every now and then.  It would stop
updating the video and eventually blank the video overlay.
Maybe this is what caused the crash in the first place?
(Sorry, this bug doesn't always occur, and I don't remember
exactly what the screen looked like during the crashes.)

The aspect ratio remains constant throughout this recording.

In case it makes any difference: softdevice is unable to
open /dev/rtc.

Here is the stack trace:

#0  0xb7cfd5ef in memcpy () from /lib/tls/libc.so.6
No symbol table info available.
#1  0xb7929daf in cDFBVideoOut::YUV (this=0x8296df8, Py=0xb4e90808 &quot;&quot;, Pu=0x82b4ab0 &quot;&quot;, 
    Pv=0x82ce750 '\177' &lt;repeats 200 times&gt;..., Width=736, Height=576, Ystride=736, 
    UVstride=368) at video-dfb.c:1166
	dst = (uint8_t *) 0xb5e94ea0 &lt;Address 0xb5e94ea0 out of bounds&gt;
	pitch = 704
	hi = 137160880
#2  0xb791b15f in cVideoOut::Action (this=0x8296df8) at video.c:107
	newOsdWidth = 736
	newOsdHeight = 576
	changeMode = false
#3  0x080f1c32 in cThread::StartThread (Thread=0x8296df8) at thread.c:234
No locals.
#4  0xb7ee7ccd in start_thread () from /lib/tls/libpthread.so.0
No symbol table info available.
#5  0xb7d5fb0e in clone () from /lib/tls/libc.so.6
No symbol table info available.

Compare it to a previous stack trace that occurred after hitting the
Suspend key (of my vdr-suspend patch):

#0  0xb7d755ef in memcpy () from /lib/tls/libc.so.6
No symbol table info available.
#1  0xb79a1daf in cDFBVideoOut::YUV (this=0x827c410, Py=0xb4ef8808 &quot;&quot;, Pu=0x829bbb8 &quot;&quot;, 
    Pv=0x82b5858 '\177' &lt;repeats 200 times&gt;..., Width=736, Height=576, Ystride=736, 
    UVstride=368) at video-dfb.c:1166
	dst = (uint8_t *) 0xb5f06ea0 &lt;Address 0xb5f06ea0 out of bounds&gt;
	pitch = 704
	hi = 137058744
#2  0xb799315f in cVideoOut::Action (this=0x827c410) at video.c:107
	newOsdWidth = 736
	newOsdHeight = 576
	changeMode = false
#3  0x080f1c32 in cThread::StartThread (Thread=0x827c410) at thread.c:234
No locals.
#4  0xb7f5fccd in start_thread () from /lib/tls/libpthread.so.0
No symbol table info available.
#5  0xb7dd7b0e in clone () from /lib/tls/libc.so.6
No symbol table info available.

Note that in cDFBVideoOut::YUV(), the local variable &quot;hi&quot; is garbage
in both cases.

One more thing: I have got some crashes when starting to view a
recording while the disk containing it is spun down.  VDR would crash
while the disk is spinning up.  This occurs quite rarely, and I have
been unable to get a stack trace.  I believe that those crashes could
be due to this same bug.
