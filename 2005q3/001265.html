The speed shouldn't be a problem because I think it works fine without the 
field-sync patches.

&gt;<i> &gt; Probably you should try to switch of the wait on sync in the

</I>&gt;<i> That should be easy. For I420 and YV12 modes, it's around line 1260.

</I>&gt;<i> could be changed to:
</I>&gt;<i> videoSurface-&gt;Flip();
</I>&gt;<i> or:
</I>&gt;<i> videoSurface-&gt;Flip(NULL, DSFLIP_WAITFORSYNC);
</I>
I've just tried both of them and I don't see any real differences between 
them!

Does StretchBlit work on Unichrome? Should I try enabling that? I think it 
bailed out when I tried it before.

&gt;<i> The actual handling and meaning of displaydelay handling is, that in

</I>&gt;<i> be translated we arrived between display_time and display_time -
</I>&gt;<i> 1_frametime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For following the mails on the directfb lists, there was one thing which
</I>&gt;<i> makes me puzzeld: the cpu load dropped after some kernel/directfb patches
</I>&gt;<i> were applied, from around 70% to 30% percent, and that is too low.
</I>
I'm not sure how I was getting those low values but that was before I'd got it 
working properly. As I have it now (df_xine works fine but softdevice A-V 
sync bad and variable) I'm generally seeing about 50% CPU usage for vdr + 
softdevice.

&gt;<i> Currently I'm on the way to upgrade my epia test system. That is now on:
</I>&gt;<i> 	kernel: 2.6.13.2
</I>&gt;<i> 		epia-patch from patcher2k: patcher2k.viafb_03.diff
</I>&gt;<i> 	directfb:
</I>&gt;<i> 		cvs from today (2005-09-23).
</I>
Denis Oliver Kropp is working on patching that patch(!) and submitting the 
changes back to patcher2k. See 
<A HREF="http://mail.directfb.org/pipermail/directfb-users/2005-September/000660.html">http://mail.directfb.org/pipermail/directfb-users/2005-September/000660.html</A>

He's also working on implementing hardware MPEG decoding into DirectFB.

Cheers,

Laz
