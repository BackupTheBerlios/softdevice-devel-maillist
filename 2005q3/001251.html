Good good. I had this system going quite well with the xine plugin but 
starting X is an extra complexity and it slowed right down when the OSD was 
visible!

I've just upgraded to vdr-1.3.32 and softdevice from cvs. It seems better than 
it was with softdevice-1.3.0 but I may be imagining that! At the moment, A-V 
sync drifts about a bit on live TV and on recordings; first impressions are 
that it is in sync more for live TV than for recordings. With the previous 
version of softdevice, recordings were out of sync most of the time and the 
video went jittery, presumably as it tried to resync. I don't think it is 
jittery with the cvs version I just checked out but I haven't tested it fully 
yet!

If you can suggest anything for me to test, please do.

&gt;<i> &gt; One other thing I have found is that if I use a skin using text2skin, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get no transparent backgrounds to the OSD. This is the case for at least
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the enElchi and Deep Blue, and Enigma skins, although the EgalSimple skin
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does have  a transparent background. The standard vdr skin and the ST:TNG
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; panels skins both have transparent backgrounds and work fine! All of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these skins do have transparent backgrounds with the xine plugin.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is this a know problem?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's a hardware limitation. Once I saw  (directfb code ?) that

</I>&gt;<i> know if it is possible to change the used alpha values of skins.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did a search through current directfb code (on my some months

Ahhh...that would make sense. I will look at the actual alpha values used in 
the various skins: the colours are defines as ARGB quartets so can easily be 
changed.

Cheers,

Laz
