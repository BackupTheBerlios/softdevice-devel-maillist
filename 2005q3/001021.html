Why would you need another configuration option?  The purpose of the
crop left/right/up/down settings is to remove junk from the pixel data.
If if that pixel data has already been cropped because of a CropMode
setting, why would you need this?

Is it necessary to have the crop settings (or other seldomly used
settings) on OSD?  Would it suffice to have them in the configuration
file only?

If I remember correctly, all errors were in the VDR code, maybe all related
to the patches supplied with the subtitles plugin.  I didn't fix any warnings.

Doh, my wake-on-remote device still can't signal if the computer was
powered on by remote or not, and I spent several hours debugging.
I also figured out how to read the signal (the initial state of the
IR input) in the cx88 driver.  I guess the status is best passed to
user space via some special ioctl.  I don't think my patches related
to this will have any chance of getting accepted to the kernel,
softdevice or VDR.
