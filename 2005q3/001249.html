<PRE>Hi,

I've just been setting up an Epia system and finally got softdevice going 
relatively well with DirectFB output (using patches for the patcher2k kernel 
module and DirectFB from Mark Adams on the directfb-users list).

So far, it seems to work quite well, especially in terms of the OSD compared 
with the xine plugin because the OSD is on a separate layer for softdevice. 
The main problem I can see at the moment is that A-V sync seems to drift 
about quite a bit but I know that this is under further development form 
monitoring this list.

One other thing I have found is that if I use a skin using text2skin, I get no 
transparent backgrounds to the OSD. This is the case for at least the enElchi 
and Deep Blue, and Enigma skins, although the EgalSimple skin does have  a 
transparent background. The standard vdr skin and the ST:TNG panels skins 
both have transparent backgrounds and work fine! All of these skins do have 
transparent backgrounds with the xine plugin.

Is this a know problem? I had thought it was just the text2skin ones which 
lost their transparency until I found that the EgalSimple skin is 
transparent! Having said that, the skins do render without other artifacts, 
unlike with the xine plugin where OSD colours didn't always appear as 
expected.

This is with vdr-1.3.30, softdevice-0.1.3, and text2skin cvs from 14/8/05.

Cheers,

Laz
