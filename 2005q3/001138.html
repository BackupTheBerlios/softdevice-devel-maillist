<PRE>Thank you for your fast and helpful answer. See below.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I finally got the kernel frame-buffer driver from viaarena to work with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>DirectFB. I can provide a patch against that viafb code to anyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>(change accelerator ID to match DirectFB + yvirtres reporting).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Drawback is that that viafb doesnt seem to handle virtual Y resolution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>correctly, thus no double-buffering can work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm using the 'patcher2k' version of viafb (with some enhancements for
</I>&gt;<i> interlace) and can use double buffering or triple buffering in
</I>&gt;<i> DirectFB with no problems.
</I>
This patch is simply a side-effect of my researches for perfect 720x576
(I first tried with this driver because it has 3 modes : overscan,
undersan and fit-to-screen, which should have been quite noscale, but in
fact isn't).
I tried tuning both the patcher2k and the viaarena drivers, WRT TV-out.
BTW, the correspondance between TV tables of both drivers are not so
difficult to understand.

&gt;&gt;<i>On the tv-out 720x576 no-scale front, I'm stuck... I understood a lot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>about that VT1622 registers and their behaviour, but I still need advice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>about the CRTC registers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>For what I know : I need to adjust CRTC (Unichrome chip) registers to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>generate a 720x576 or 800x600 timing at 50hz, 28.000Mhz dotclock,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>non-interlaced. Then the VT1622 will drive the Unichrome chip clock and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>convert the VGA signal into S-Video signals, merging pixels vertically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>(lines) or horizontally), to fit exact PAL timing (keeping one line out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>of two to generate an interlaced signal).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Since the VT1622 does not have a frame buffer, it must receive at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>input a similar timing than the PAL output.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe my setup has the CLE266 generating a 720x576/50 Hz
</I>&gt;<i> progressive picture with 27 MHz clock (28 will give you incorrect
</I>&gt;<i> horizontal scaling but shouldn't cause the problems you describe). 
</I>
I got the 28Mhz figure from the VT1622 spec sheet, found by Googling (I
can provide the PDF if needed).
You also sent me an fb.modes section stating 28Mhz. fbset -s currently
report the following (with the patcher2k driver) :

mode &quot;720x576-50&quot;
    # D: 28.000 MHz, H: 31.250 kHz, V: 50.000 Hz
    geometry 720 576 720 1152 32
    timings 35714 32 8 46 0 136 3
    rgba 8/16,8/8,8/0,8/24
endmode

&gt;<i> The VT1622A (in my case) is then programmed with suitable PLL settings
</I>&gt;<i> to sync to this picture and generate the 625 line PAL picture. 
</I>&gt;<i> Scaling and filtering is turned off in the VT1622A.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you're probably right that the VT1622/1622A does not have a
</I>&gt;<i> frame buffer but it must have a buffer of a few lines in order to do
</I>&gt;<i> the filtering and scaling.
</I>
That's my understanding.

&gt;&gt;<i>What I have with various sort of CRTC timing is a &quot;out-of-range scan&quot; on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the VGA monitor (thus black screen), and a totally disturbed &quot;image&quot; on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the TV (when it does not blank the screen the same way the monitor does).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Many VGA monitors will not like the 50 Hz frame rate (and maybe not
</I>&gt;<i> the 31.25 kHz line rate either).  I've mainly been using flat panel
</I>&gt;<i> displays: some of them are happy, some are not.
</I>
The above timing currently show a stable image on the SOny monitor (but
width/height do not fit the screen and adjusting them is not possible
because even 0% or 100% adjustment is not enough -- depending on the
scale to be adjustement).
The CRTC timings modified by the vt1622 tool (either the original one
from the unichrome project, or your modified one) do not provide a
timing suitable for the monitor.

&gt;<i> You should get a nice picture on the TV screen though.  Is the TV
</I>&gt;<i> locked but the image disturbed (and possibly
</I>&gt;<i> scrolling/flickering/sheared/duplicated) or is it unlocked (if you're
</I>&gt;<i> ears are young enough, you'd hear a different tone from the TV than
</I>&gt;<i> when it was getting a good signal)?  If the latter, your configuration
</I>&gt;<i> of the TV chip must be incorrect for the picture that the CLE266 is
</I>&gt;<i> putting out such that the TV chip can't generate a valid signal.  If
</I>&gt;<i> the former, your problem is more likely to be in the CLE266 or the
</I>&gt;<i> input-side parameters of the VT1622.
</I>
Depending on the parameters set (I'll make new tests and report exact
values), I have either case. The worst is that the TV set also decides
to blank the screen depending on the type of errors in the signal.
Even with a disturbed image on screen, I don't know which register to
adjust to change the image the right way (many adjustments switch the TV
to blanking mode...)

&gt;&gt;<i>I'm nearly giving-up... Any advice regarding CRTC registers, docs about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>them, different variant of chips in the VIA Unichrome line, is welcome.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Try posting the output from the vt1622 utility from the unichrome
</I>&gt;<i> project when you type 'D' and I'll see if I can spot anything obvious.
</I>
I'll do. Thanks.

&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
