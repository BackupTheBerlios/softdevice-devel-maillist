</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Playmodes are requested by the cPlayer class which open the output
devices for playback. Usually the user doesn't have to care about that
and usually if a player requests audio/video only it also sends only
audio/video, so I don't think we will get into trouble with this hack.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>By the way, I think that the VDR &quot;suspended&quot; flag would have to be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>examined in cDevice::PlayPesPacket().  I believe that it is best to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>make the flag independent of the play mode, like the softdevice
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>suspended flag currently is.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>This would only work in transfer and replay mode. I'm not sure about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>this since I don't own a FF card, but as far as I know FF cards usually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>don't use transfer mode while watching TV. So in case you want to ask
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Klaus to introduce the patch into mainline vdr I guess you have to do it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>differently, or take extra care of the FF cards.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I guess the patch simply wouldn't suspend live playback on FF
</I>&gt;<i> cards.  It shouldn't break anything; it'd just make the user experience
</I>&gt;<i> a bit inconsistent.  I don't have high hopes of getting the patch
</I>&gt;<i> accepted to VDR, but we'll see.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I would appreaciate a feature like suspend in main vdr, and the better
the patch is made, the better are the chances to get it accepted.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>But I don't know how to switch off the non-transfer mode for FF card,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>however I guess it should not be difficult.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't be too sure about that.  It depends on how the proprietary
</I>&gt;<i> firmware of the cards has been written.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>For replay of recordings the stream directly from the tuner to the
decoder has to be stopped, so it has to be possible. If you now just
don't anything of to replay the decoding should be stopped :-)
Well, I don't know for sure I don't own a FF card...
