</I>Hmm so it is not the kernel which did the change but the softdevice
version.
I attached another patch which is for the softdevice cvs but I think it
should apply as well to softdevice-0.1.2, it prints the raw delay like
the softdevice gets it from libasound as well as the delay like it is
used for the A-V synchronisation.
Maybe there is an integer overflow in the calculation of the delay, but
I doubt that, I would not expect to get 0 in that case...
Are you using MPlayer? I'm just a bit curious, maybe you can try to
check if MPlayer is getting the audio delay correctly. To do this you
have to edit libao2/ao_alsa.c in MPlayer's source directory. Search for
get_delay and print out the result of their delay calculation, please
note that they are useing floats for the delay.

&gt;<i> How can we debug this further?  Should I try a sound card (ES1371)
</I>&gt;<i> instead of the onboard via82xx?
</I>Strange, I'm useing also a via82xx, kernel 2.6.12 without any problems.
But I'm useing an older alsa-library: 1.0.3b.

I'm not so shure what to do. If MPlayer has the correct audio delay,
maybe the softdevice queries the audio delay the wrong way. But there is
hardly anything which one could do wrong.
So I suspect the alsa library or the alsa driver is buggy, but I would
like to have that verified with some other program.
You can also try another soundcard, maybe it's the driver after all...

I wonder how many people have this problems, as Stefan already stated if
you build some alsa filter chains the delay is not reported correctly.
Do you use by any chance some alsa filters?

I guess we can try to work around that by just using the system clock to
calculate the audio delay, but then we wouldn't be able to detect drifts
of the sound clock.

Thanks for you reports!
Martin
