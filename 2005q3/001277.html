<PRE>&gt;<i> Stefan Lucke a &#233;crit :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess the source of your problem is in the unichrome-directfb.diff
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mark Adams 2005-09-07 on directfb-user list (if you are using that).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Won't say that it is faulty or wrong, but from reading I guess it does
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wait always for frame change to happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mark doesn't use softdevice, so it might be that softdevice and that
</I>&gt;<i> patch do not agree on something.
</I>
That's the gist of it, I think. I get perfect playback with df_xine using
Marks's patches for viafb and DirectFB.

The output I'm getting from softdevice is almost there... I get quite a
smooth picture with the odd dropped frame (or dropped several frames) but
the audio contains a dropout / glitch every second or so! It's justa bout
watchable, once you get used to it!

;-)

&gt;&gt;<i> Other applications have a separate thread, which does only the flip.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So they are not affected by that change.
</I>
My current feeling is that it is a timing problem somewhere: there is the
frame time determined from two WaitForSync calls (not quite worked out
what this is used for: is this used for timing the Flip calls?).

&gt;<i> I don't even know how Mark can report proper field, except by counting
</I>&gt;<i> each and every frame out from the CLE266, and making sure the TV encoder
</I>&gt;<i> starts with the right field upon setup. Any frame miss will lead to the
</I>&gt;<i> wrong field identification, until the next frame miss...
</I>
I think his patch to viafb does make it keep count of the number of fields!

&gt;&gt;<i> A real problem for me is that, I don't get any sound out of my epia
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> board.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Would be nice if some could help with a working asound.state for such a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> board or required module parms for via82xx. I tried ac97_quirk=[0,1]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but that made no difference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please see mine attached. I didn't ever edited that file and don't even
</I>&gt;<i> know what it contains. I got it from /var/lib/alsa/asound.state on my
</I>&gt;<i> EPIA M10k, Debian sarge with an old history. It worked from the beginning.
</I>
I might give it a go, too, to see if it sorts out my bizarre stuttering!

Cheers,

Laz
