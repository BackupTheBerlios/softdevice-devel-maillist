</I>On my old box (1GHz AMD) I never noticed an increased CPU usage. Now I
finally moved my vdr to the new AMD64 box and there I see the increased
CPU usage clearly.

&gt;<i> In &quot;dead&quot; playback, the list looks roughly the same, except for the
</I>&gt;<i> method at top:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> samples  %        symbol name
</I>&gt;<i> 22284    13.0933  cStreamDecoder::BufferFill()
</I>Yep, that's the one which is called in Poll() to check the buffer fill.
It should be inside of the busy loop in cDvbplayer::Action().

&gt;<i> In live playback, the method cStreamDecoder::BufferFill() got only
</I>&gt;<i> 16 samples (0.0106 % of softdevice execution time).  In the output of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;opannotate -t 13 -a --source .../libvdr-softdevice-1.3.27&quot;, there
</I>&gt;<i> are two weird-looking instructions that seem to consume a lot of time.
</I>&gt;<i> Or maybe it's the preceding idiv that is consuming the time:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    187  0.1099 :   656d3:       idiv   %ecx
</I>&gt;<i>   9485  5.5731 :   656d5:       lea    (%edx,%edx,4),%edx
</I>&gt;<i>    302  0.1774 :   656d8:       lea    (%edx,%edx,4),%edx
</I>&gt;<i>    289  0.1698 :   656db:       lea    0x0(,%edx,4),%eax
</I>I guess it's the &quot;idiv&quot; instruction which uses the time. I think shifts
by one instruction is possible when using oprofile, or am I wrong?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is after the call to Available():
</I>&gt;<i>                :    inline int Available()
</I>&gt;<i> 	       :    { return (LastPacket+MaxPackets - FirstPacket)%MaxPackets; }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;+MaxPackets&quot; is redundant, isn't it?  (Unless LastPacket&lt;FirstPacket,
</I>&gt;<i> of course.)
</I>The PacketBuffer is a ringbuffer, so LastPacket maybe smaller than
FirstPacket.

&gt;<i> BTW, any chance of introducing the &quot;suspended&quot; flag to vdr itself?
</I>&gt;<i> That'd go with some auto-power-off logic, i.e., if suspended=true
</I>&gt;<i> and vdr is currently recording, turn power off after the recording
</I>&gt;<i> is completed (after some short timeout).  That'd make vdr much easier
</I>&gt;<i> to use for my wife.  (We're recording children's programs daily, and
</I>&gt;<i> she leaves the computer on, because she won't retry if the timed
</I>&gt;<i> recording is still going on at the time she tries to power the
</I>&gt;<i> system off.)
</I>Hmm, you should ask that question on the vdr maillinglist.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Should there perhaps be a bug reporting system or a list of known
</I>&gt;<i> bugs on the web page?  I have reported two bugs earlier that still
</I>&gt;<i> appear to be there with vdr-1.3.27 and current softdevice CVS.
</I>There is a bug tracking system for the softdevice at:

<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=2051">http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=2051</A>

&gt;<i> First, the Power key is ignored when playing back recordings.
</I>I don't think this bug is softdevice related, the softdevice has no
chance to interfere on keypress events (except for those keys which are
used for the control of Xv which are not delivered to vdr).

&gt;<i> Second, vdr crashes with Signal 11 when selecting &quot;Restart&quot; (sp?,
</I>&gt;<i> my OSD is in Finnish).
</I>I will try to have a look at this.

Bye,
Martin
