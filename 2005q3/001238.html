I'd like to get softdevice reliable as your promises.

&gt;<i> vdr was recording and viewing the same program.
</I>&gt;<i> Before the crash, a recording was watched for maybe 30 minutes.  Then
</I>&gt;<i> vdr was suspended for maybe an hour.  During that time, the timed recording

</I>&gt;<i> program was shown for about 5 minutes.  I didn't touch the remote control
</I>&gt;<i> during that time, so it shouldn't be OSD related at this time.
</I>
Yes, as it doesn't seem to be the original OSD crash, I'm going
to commit that change.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Luckily, I got a core dump this time.  See the attached two dumps of
</I>&gt;<i> the stack trace.  For some reason, &quot;bt full&quot; truncates the trace.
</I>&gt;<i> Could it be a double free() call?  Has anyone run softdevice under
</I>&gt;<i> Valgrind?  (Should I try, or will it be hopelessly slow?)
</I>
I tried valgrind once on my 2.2GHz box but it was terrible. Recommened
cpu is something like a 6GHz P4 :-) .

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have saved the stderr output in case it will help troubleshooting.
</I>&gt;<i> I normally log stderr to /tmp, which lives on shmfs.
</I>
Is there a caught exception message like:
&quot;[dfb] YUV: action=%s, result=%s\n&quot;

The messages just before the crash happend, would be interesting.

Hm, Width and Height values are bogous.
