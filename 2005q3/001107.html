<PRE>I think I've reported this earlier, but now I got a little more
information.

At the end of a recording, the screen sometimes remains black, and no
MPEG decoding seems to take place from the currently selected channel.
Flipping the IsSuspended flag doesn't have any effect.  Output will
be restored after switching channels.

This bug does not occur every week for me.  The probability of it
occurring at the end of a recording can be at most a few percent.
This time, I'm rather sure that it is a softdevice bug, because
subtitles were displayed although the display was otherwise black.
I was viewing YLE TV1, and I'm using vdr 1.3.27, softdevice-cvs
and subtitles-0.3.8.

Another rare bug I mentioned earlier happened again some time ago.  At
startup, vdr used only a few percent of CPU time (normal is 30-40 %)
and showed a very small frame rate (at most one or two frames per
second).  I have the feeling that it is some race condition that could
be solved by additional locking.  I believe that this bug could probably
be made repeatable by adding some delay to the startup of one of the
threads.  I would try this myself if I were familiar with the thread
structure of vdr.
