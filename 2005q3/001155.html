Sorry, the correct link is
<A HREF="http://www.funet.fi/~msmakela/electronics/relay/vdr-suspend.patch">http://www.funet.fi/~msmakela/electronics/relay/vdr-suspend.patch</A>
Please see also the discussion at

There are a few glitches in the old patch you tried.  The new one is
simpler.  I'm happy that even the old patch worked for you.

&gt;<i> Actually this is the prefered mode for me. So my personal suggestion
</I>&gt;<i> would be just to use the power key, and extend it's features. If the
</I>&gt;<i> power key is pressed, shutdown in case of no recording and the -s option
</I>&gt;<i> was given, otherwise just suspend the mpeg2 decoding.
</I>&gt;<i> That would be the natural behaviour for me.
</I>
Yes, I'll probably map my Power key to Suspend.  I don't think that the
behaviour of the Power key can be changed; I got some negative feedback
for my patch to obey the Power key during playback.  We can make this
happen by calling the key something else. :-)

There is one glitch though, maybe related to DirectFB or the cx88-input
driver: Repeated keypresses (with the RC5 toggle bit not toggling) are
reported as new ones.  So, I would have to be very very careful to press
the Suspend key exactly once.  If I keep it pressed down longer, vdr would
cycle between suspended/active, or worse still, suspended/confirm/active.
If no recording is going on, vdr will display the &quot;Press any key to
cancel shutdown&quot; message.  If vdr gets two keypresses from the Suspend
key, playback will remain suspended, but the shutdown timeout will be
cancelled without any visual feedback to the user.

&gt;<i> cDevice-&gt;Clear() just clears the input buffers, so I guess it is not
</I>&gt;<i> meant to clear the screen. Maybe a call to SetPlayMode(pmNone) would
</I>&gt;<i> help, if I understand dvbplayer.c correctly that would work even for FF
</I>&gt;<i> cards. Of course you'll have to restore the playmode on resume...
</I>
Thanks, I'll try that.  Can SetPlayMode be called from any thread?

I noticed that it'd be better not to call cDevice::Clear() when playing
recordings, because then Suspend will better act as Pause (it won't
drop any B or P frames).

Can you or someone else help me to introduce a menu item for the suspend
timeout to the vdr setup/playback menu?  The timeout would be given in
seconds, and the value zero would disable the shutdown timeout.  Also
the logic in vdr.c needs to be changed a little.  It'd be better to
keep the inactivity timeout and the suspend shutdown timeout distinct
from each other.

	Marko
