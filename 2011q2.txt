Comment:
Log() may end up using the arg list twice without calling va_end() and va_start() again which crashes immediately for me. The attached patch fixes it.

Subject: [Softdevice-devel] Softdevice with vdr versions newer than 1.7.0?
Message-ID: <201104140937.20756.laz@club-burniston.co.uk>


Hi,

I was beginning to think that softdevice was no longer being developed but 
was pleased to see a couple of CVS updates.

Has anyone had any success with using softdevice with any versions of vdr 
more recent than 1.7.0? This was when the change to TS happened.

Whenever I've tried it, I get sound but no video. I've not delved too 
deeply into this (and it was a while back that I tried this) because I was 
thinking that development on softdevice had stopped and it would probably 
never work with newer vdr versions.

Has anyone had any success with this? Presumably the decoding by 
libavcodec would still work the same but softdevice might need a bit of 
tweaking to extract frames properly from the TS?

Cheers,

Laz

Nice to see that there is someone still following the cvs list.

You'll find a patch attached which does work in "some way" with vdr-1.7.15.

It is not stable and sometimes it does not show video for some old
recordings, but it does show contend of german ARD HD & ZDF HD free
to air stations.
OSD is shown in upper left corner and drawing method has to be set to
software for my onboard card:
[    38.290] (--) RADEON(0): Chipset: "ATI Radeon HD 3200 Graphics" (ChipID = 0x9610)

Other disappointing thing is cpu consumption. Even my "AMD 64 X2 5600+"
is not enough: one core at it's limits and the other one idleing ;-) .

Output method must be restructred, as decoding and displaying is done
in one thread (if I read the sources correct).

I won't promise to much, but let's see what could be done.

I'd not seen any traffic in a long while and was pleasantly surprised! I'm 
still happily using softdevice with a Matrox G450.

Good stuff. I'll try to test it over the next few days...

Where I am (uk), we still don't have any terrestrial HD channels (can get 
them from satellites, though). Until I can receive HD easily, I don't want 
to have to build a meaty vdr box to handle the HD stuff or delve into 
VDPAU or similar.

Looking at your patch, I think I'll have to undo some of the resolution 
changes you've made for HD!

Sounds good. I've always much preferred the way softdevice doesn't require 
X to be running because it's one fewer layers to go wrong! There was some 
interest a few weeks back on the vdr mailing list about creating an output 
plugin that can provide output without X when softdevice has been doing it 
for years!

Unfortunately, I think VDPAU and similar are tightly integrated into X, 
which is a pain. I don't think it's possible to feed frames to the VDPAU 
libraries and output directly to a frame buffer but I could be wrong!

Cheers,

Laz

Sorry, it took a while.
Thank you very much. Applied.
