It would be helpful to link libvdr-softdevice-dfb.so and libvdr-softdevice.so
statically with the vdr executable, so that complete stack traces can be
obtained.  For some reason, I was unable to get oprofile's opstack to work
yet.  (I had similar problems on other systems, so that's nothing new.)
Thus, I got the statistics for &quot;vdr&quot; and the softdevice libraries separately.
Here is the top for vdr when playing live stream:

CPU: PIII, speed 906.845 MHz (estimated)
Counted CPU_CLK_UNHALTED events (clocks processor is not halted) with a unit mask of 0x00 (No unit mask) count 9000
samples  %        symbol name
11330    14.0482  cRemux::ScanVideoPacket(unsigned char const*, int, int, unsigned char&amp;)
8735     10.8306  cSchedule::GetEvent(unsigned short, long) const
5337      6.6174  SI::CRC32::crc32(char const*, int, unsigned int)
3364      4.1711  cSectionHandler::Action()
2618      3.2461  cChannels::GetByChannelID(tChannelID, bool, bool)
2286      2.8344  cDevice::Action()
2055      2.5480  cTS2PES::instant_repack(unsigned char const*, int)
1813      2.2480  cSchedules::GetSchedule(tChannelID) const
1789      2.2182  cRingBufferLinear::Put(unsigned char const*, int)
1568      1.9442  cRingBuffer::UpdatePercentage(int)
[truncated]

And here is the list for libvdr-softdevice-dfb:

samples  %        symbol name
9980     84.3832  cDFBVideoOut::YUV(unsigned char*, unsigned char*, unsigned char*, int, int, int, int)
581       4.9125  cVideoOut::CheckAspectDimensions(AVFrame*, AVCodecContext*)
453       3.8302  cDFBVideoOut::SetParams()
425       3.5935  cVideoOut::CheckAspect(int, float)
343       2.9001  cDFBRemote::Action()
45        0.3805  cDFBVideoOut::ProcessEvents()
[complete list]

Finally, here is the list for libvdr-softdevice:

samples  %        symbol name
2986     26.1219  cVideoStreamDecoder::DecodePacket(AVPacket*)
1320     11.5475  cStreamDecoder::Action()
1083      9.4742  cMpeg2Decoder::read_packet(unsigned char*, int)
956       8.3632  cAudioStreamDecoder::DecodePacket(AVPacket*)
740       6.4736  cRelTimer::GetRelTime()
533       4.6628  cSoftRingBufferLinear::Available()
466       4.0766  cPacketQueue::PutPacket(AVPacket const&amp;)
433       3.7879  cMpeg2Decoder::Action()
426       3.7267  cMpeg2Decoder::DecodePacket(AVFormatContext const*, AVPacket&amp;)347       3.0356  cAlsaAudioOut::SetParams(SampleContext&amp;)
323       2.8256  cAlsaAudioOut::Write(unsigned char*, int)
301       2.6332  cAudioStreamDecoder::GetPTS()
265       2.3183  cPacketQueue::GetReadPacket()
223       1.9508  cClock::GetPTS()
[truncated]

It seems that the percentages are relative to that executable only.  But the
numbers of samples should be global.  So, even though cDFBVideoOut::YUV()
seems to consume a large percentage of CPU cycles, at 9980 samples it's
behind cRemux::ScanVideoPacket(), which has been sampled 11330 times.

It'd be really helpful to link the plugins statically to vdr, because then
the percentage figures could be compared directly, and also stack traces would
look more meaningful.  How can that be done?

If you want to play with oprofile yourself, be sure to enable the following
in the kernel:
CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC=y
CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC=y
You may also need to add &quot;lapic&quot; to the kernel command line.  Otherwise,
oprofile will fall back to using a generic timer, which is not very useful
and does not even seem to work.

I did another profiling run when playing a recorded stream.  All charts were
quite different.  So, the profiling run definitely has to be repeatable
(always playing the same stream) in order to get meaningful results.

By the way, selecting YUY2 pixel format seems to hang some VDR thread after
hitting OK: neither the remote control nor the svdrp connection do nothing,
and the watchdog timer will expire.  It looks like I420 is the appropriate
format for my MGA G450 card.

&gt;<i> &gt;Thanks! Of course, a cleaner way would be to introduce a virtual method
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;void suspendPlayback(bool) that all plugins could override.  That would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;have some chance of being included in some VDR release. 
</I>&gt;<i> I doubt that a function like that would be included in the VDR. I think 
</I>&gt;<i> there was a discussion about this kind of function some time ago..
</I>
Okay.  Anyway, this will not be needed if you can figure out how to get
the timing right without using the RTC device.

&gt;<i> &gt;Now I tried the latest CVS on VDR 1.3.22 and 1.3.23, and subtitles-plugin
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;0.3.7 (<A HREF="http://www.virtanen.org/vdr/subtitles/">http://www.virtanen.org/vdr/subtitles/</A>).  Unfortunately, I don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;see any subtitles with the latest CVS, neither from live stream nor from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;recordings.  I updated only the setup parsing code from the CVS version,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;and it worked.  
</I>&gt;<i> Just to be sure that I understand correctly: before the setup parsing 
</I>&gt;<i> update the subtitles plugin was working and now it's not working 
</I>&gt;<i> anymore? Strange, that's hard to explain. Did you try to go back to the 
</I>&gt;<i> old version?
</I>
I have a snapshot &quot;softdevice-work.tar.gz&quot; from about 3 weeks ago, which
I guess I downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.lucke.in-berlin.de/vdr-softdevice-work.tar.gz">http://www.lucke.in-berlin.de/vdr-softdevice-work.tar.gz</A> when the berlios
server was unavailable.  (It worked on Saturday but didn't on Sunday, or
something like that.)

The CVS snapshot I took on March 31 didn't display any subtitles.  I haven't
tried a more recent CVS snapshot yet.  So, I took the old snapshot and
patched the setup parsing code there.

&gt;<i> On a related note, does softdevice implement the GetSTC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;method accurately?  The subtitles plugin needs that for displaying the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;subtitles at the right time.  (They are usually transmitted a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;seconds before they should be displayed, and now it seems that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;subtitles are displayed too early.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I thought GetSTC was implemented correctly, but I may be wrong. By the 
</I>&gt;<i> way I experienced an similar effect with subtitles in dvds, but I did 
</I>&gt;<i> not investigate it further...
</I>
Of course, it could also be a problem in the stream itself.  I haven't seen
subtitles in any other DVB-T receiver, so I can't say for sure.  The
subtitles seem to work much better in softdevice than dxr3, where the
subtitles often appear in bursts.  However, sometimes the subtitles
could be one or two seconds too early.

Finally, I noticed another interesting thing: the subtitles will continue to
change, even if playback is suspended!
