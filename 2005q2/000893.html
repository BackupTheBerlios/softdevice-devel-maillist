I just verified this by recording a couple of seconds from a blue-bar
channel and viewing the 001.vdr file in a MPlayer window on another
computer.  Maybe this blue bar has something to do with the color burst
in PAL signal?  Many Commodore computers output a white vertical bar at
the very left of the image.

This is not the only imperfection you can see near the edges.  I've been
recording an old animated series for my 2-year-old son.  It's from the
analog times in 4:3 format, and there is a black vertical bar at the
left of the picture.  However, when it scrolls credits at the bottom of
the screen, the left-hand-side of the credits will overwrite that black
bar.

This reminds me from the Commodore times: I used to view demos with all
overscan areas visible.  Most rasterbar effects had imperfections in
the horizontal borders.

You're just not supposed to see the overscan area.  A (preferrably
per-channel) configureable cropping mode would be the solution if you
can't make the bar disappear by touching the monitor settings.  The bar
doesn't disturb me too much, as I'm using an old 14&quot; VGA monitor.
