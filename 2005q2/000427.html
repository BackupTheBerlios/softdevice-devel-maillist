<PRE>Martin Wache a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> so here is the first version of my media player for the vdr with
</I>&gt;<i> softdevice as output device. It plays .avi with various codecs (if
</I>&gt;<i> supported by ffmpeg) and .mp3.
</I>
Great ! Congratulations !

&gt;<i> PS: Stefan and me have started a discussion wether to include this 
</I>&gt;<i> SoftPlay plugin into the SoftDevice while the mailing list was down...
</I>&gt;<i> Now I'm curious what you think about this. Basicly there are two ways:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -Include everything in the softdevice (only one plugin) and have compile
</I>&gt;<i>  options to decide what to be build.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -Seperate plugins: a softdevice mostly like it is now, and have a
</I>&gt;<i>  seperate plugin which implements the player capabilities.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Stefan prefers the first possibility, I prefer the first.
</I>&gt;<i> Which way would do you like better?
</I>
 From the packager's point of view, I think the second solution would be 
a little better (don't have to create two packages : just compile 
everything, and let the user decide if he actually loads the player)
But it's not that important, in fact...
The real question seems to be : who will actually *not* want to have a 
media-player-capable softdevice VDR ? I mean, in the softdevice context, 
where you use the full-featured VGA card instead of the limited MPEG 
output of the DVB card, will there be a lot of people not wanting to 
view Divx, especially since VGA output is *the* way to view Divx ?
