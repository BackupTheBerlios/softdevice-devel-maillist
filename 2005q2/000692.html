Shouldn't that extra buffering be done by the output method, as that
kind of OSD mixing is already done within dfb.

Here I see some troubles, as softplay needs a change in softdevice
for pause handling. So there should be a release of softdevice too.
Hm, release 0.1.1 shows a similar behaviour so fixing that
can be delayed.

So there should be only changes to softdevice, if there are impacts
of latest ffmpeg time effects on softplay which have to be handled
in softdevice too.
