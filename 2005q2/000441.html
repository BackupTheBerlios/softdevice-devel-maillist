</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now I'm curious what you think about this. Basicly there are two ways:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -Seperate plugins: a softdevice mostly like it is now, and have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  seperate plugin which implements the player capabilities.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Stefan prefers the first possibility, I prefer the first.

The first too :-) ?, I thought the second.

&gt;<i> &gt; Which way would do you like better?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  From the packager's point of view, I think the second solution would be 
</I>&gt;<i> a little better (don't have to create two packages : just compile 
</I>&gt;<i> everything, and let the user decide if he actually loads the player)
</I>&gt;<i> But it's not that important, in fact...
</I>
As I got my own extension work right now, DV camcorder access,
I think makeing a separate plugin like soft-IEEE1394 is the better
way as there could be separate releases independant of
softdevice release cycle. (OT shouldn't we make a new one 0.1.1?).

So we get a bunch of plugins building the softdevice plugin family.
soft-player, soft-IEEE1394, ..

&gt;<i> The real question seems to be : who will actually *not* want to have a 
</I>&gt;<i> media-player-capable softdevice VDR ? I mean, in the softdevice context, 
</I>&gt;<i> where you use the full-featured VGA card instead of the limited MPEG 
</I>&gt;<i> output of the DVB card, will there be a lot of people not wanting to 
</I>&gt;<i> view Divx, especially since VGA output is *the* way to view Divx ?
</I>
If the additional plugins are more stable and have more features,
perhaps we can integrate them back (once we have something like ./configure).

PS:
The capability of my extension is:
	- detect (report via OSD message) plugged and removed firewire devices,
	- show live stream from DV camcorder,
	- some simple camcorder commands like: PLAY, PAUSE, FF, FRew.

Tanks to Martin's packet interface.

DV decoding is a bit more CPU intensive than mpeg decoding. My P4-2.2
is occupied between 50-60 %.
