It should also say the name of the device, e.g., KBD if you didn't
compile vdr.o with make NO_KBD=1, or something like &quot;softdevice-xv&quot;
or &quot;softdevice-dfb&quot; for softdevice.

&gt;<i> Hmm.. What command should I use in directfbrc to disable the &quot;input&quot;

If the event module is missing from the kernel, it shouldn't make a
difference.  The remote control of my Hauppauge Nova-T PCI 90002
is connected via the /dev/input/event* interface, and the keycodes
are translated by the kernel, DirectFB and vdr.  I had to add some
missing keys to the kernel and DirectFB.  Last time I checked,
video4linux modules doesn't have a maintainer any more.  I'm not sure
if the DirectFB bug report I filed has been processed.

&gt;<i> &gt; I had a similar problem when I set up my VDR box.  There seems to be some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; locking issue that prevents softdevice from relaying the first remote key
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; event to VDR in learning mode.  It only worked once in 20..100 tries for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me.  I finally entered the mapping by adding some fprintf() to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; softdevice code, blindly pressing the keys, and manually editing the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; VDR remote control configuration file.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this a problem of softdevice or vdr itself? Has anyone informed the

</I>
I don't know which one is at fault.  I didn't have that problem when I used
the dxr3 plugin.  You should find the discussion in the mailing list archives
from 2 or 3 months ago.
