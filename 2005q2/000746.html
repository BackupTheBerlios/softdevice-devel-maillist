We should add -g as a default to Makefile.

Does this interfere with my posted aspect ratio patch ? 
I'll do some aditional work on directfb out. Coupling YUV2 to
stretchblit, and other formats to BES is eventually not required. So
I'll try to separate this.
You can even post a diff of an uncompleted state of work, as I somtimes
have crashes with bad signal too. Not allways in ffmpeg. When a
crash is in softdevice, it looks like a syncing issue between threads.
