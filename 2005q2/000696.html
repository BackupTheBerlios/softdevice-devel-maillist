&gt;<i> Hello,

</I>&gt;<i> The ffmpeg-devel talks about ffmpeg having XvMC support, in a

</I>Not completly output-device-independent. ffmpeg supports the NVidia type 
of XvMC, not the Unichorme XvMC (which are almost completly different). 
There are patches to ffmpeg which add Unichrome XvMC support, but I'm 
not sure if, and when they will be merged.

&gt;<i> I think the XvMC wrapper library is independent of the actual X code, 
</I>&gt;<i> and also the Unichrome XvMC driver.
</I>As far as I know that's not true. To my knowledge XvMC wrapper library 
is just a common interface to some card dependent functions which are 
provided by the Xserver.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is it possible to once have HW MPEG2 decoding on CLE266 using softdevice 
</I>&gt;<i> on DirectFB, given this infrastructure ?
</I>Maybe this question can be better answered on the DirectFB list. I guess 
once DirectFB supports HW MPEG2, we will surely have a look at it and 
make use of it if it is possible.

&gt;<i> I this code too tightly 
</I>&gt;<i> dependent on X, that it will only ever work on X ?
</I>I think the current implementation of XvMC will never work without X. 
After all it is _X_vMC ;-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is someone interested in having that in softdevice ?
</I>Interested: yes. In fact I now own a Unichrome Pro, so if it is possible 
without too much patching ffmpeg or X I would like to bring support into 
the softdevice. But to be honest up to now I didn't even get mplayer 
running with XvMC...
