Hi,

I hadn't time to try softdevice for a long time now, but now I checked 
0.1.2 and it looks very well again on my Matrox G400 TV-out (SCART-RGB, 
DirectFB). You might remember I started a thread on this ML once, about 
terrible judder. Now it's all gone, the fields are displayed in the 
right order, no more combs, it's really nice, except some (maybe) 
syncing attemp from time to time where the image jumps a little (only 
noticeable on constantly moving scenes (like scrolling text), or very 
slow motion scenes).
I also had few crashes in my testings, maybe also due to bad signal when 
switching between LNBs via 4/1 diseqc switch.

On the audio side, now there is no more AC3 decoding (maybe becasue I 
set DD5.1 SPDIF in softdevice's setup, which is not yet implemented, am 
I right?). I'll wait for the *real* AC3 passthrough feature, I hope 
that's not too hard to do.
Mono MP2 is still muted on the SPDIF (don't know if on analog speakers 
on my C-Media soundcard too, I have no analogue connection and also am a 
bit afraid to mess with the ALSA configuration), maybe an upmix to 2 
channels is required here (I  think you might actually test this on CNN 
on Astra 19.2).

To sum up, I'm glad that it works pretty well again on my G400 CRTC2 
with DFB, I know the rest is more or less on the TODO list. Thank you, 
and keep up the good work!

Lucian
