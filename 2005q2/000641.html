I didn't think of DPMS, as the monitor I'm using is too old to support it.
But of course, it would be even better to use DPMS, to (almost) power off
the monitor with the remote control.  It would be nice if the &quot;standby mode&quot;
switch did all following things:

* suspend the playback
* blank the screen (black picture + DPMS off)
* mute the audio (to reduce noise, especially for onboard audio)
* set up the timer so that when any ongoing recording stops,
  the shutdown script will be called immediately

I'm planning to build a USB-controlled triac or relay circuit, similar to
the ones advertised at <A HREF="http://www.cleware.de/p-usbswitch.html.">http://www.cleware.de/p-usbswitch.html.</A>  (I can't
use those modules, because their drivers are closed source.)  The module
would control the power supply of the monitor (perhaps later a video beamer)
and the speakers.  I think USB is the only reasonable way to do this, because
the serial port is being phased out, and parallel port based control would
require an external power supply.

&gt;<i> Which ffmpeg version (if cvs from which day) do you use ?
</I>&gt;<i> Can you try attached patch to see if it fexes that for you (too) ?
</I>
I tried ffmpeg cvs from a few days ago, and without your patch it still
crashes on the 4:3-&gt;16:9 switch of which I sent you a sample.  I'll try
applying your patch to ffmpeg later, maybe tonight or tomorrow.
