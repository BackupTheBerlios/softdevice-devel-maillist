<PRE>Martin,

&gt;<i> &gt;I guess so.  If not on the Celeron of my VDR box, I can play some 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;recordings
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;on this Pentium-M and look for DCU_MISS_OUTSTANDING
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(number of cycles while DCU miss outstanding; DCU=data cache unit) or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;DATA_MEM_REFS (all memory references, cachable and non).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;opcontrol --list-events lists all possible events, but I can't start up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;my VDR box now.
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds good. I never tried to do it until now but also my new AMD64 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to have this option, but I will check again.
</I>
DCU_MISS_OUTSTANDING is available on Pentium III, including Celeron.

&gt;<i> Do you have any experience on this?
</I>
I measured InnoDB performance and found out that data cache miss made
a single machine instruction use several percent of total execution
time in one test case.  It was accessing the InnoDB adaptive hash index,
which of course wouldn't fit in the cache memory.  Actually, the execution
time was reported for an instruction one or two positions after the actual
data fetch.  I guess this is due to pipelining.

I just made a measurement with 
opcontrol --event=DCU_MISS_OUTSTANDING:7500
on the beginning of a recorded clip, containing mostly computer-generated
images but also some talking heads.  Here's the top from
opreport -t1 -l PLUGINS/lib/libvdr-softdevice.so.1.3.24:

CPU: PIII, speed 906.672 MHz (estimated)
Counted DCU_MISS_OUTSTANDING events (number of cycles while DCU miss
outstanding) with a unit mask of 0x00 (No unit mask) count 7500

29079     5.6429  avg_pixels16_mmx2
21563     4.1844  avg_pixels8_mmx2
21021     4.0792  put_pixels8_x2_mmx2
19272     3.7398  put_pixels8_y2_mmx2
13639     2.6467  avg_pixels16_x2_mmx2
12241     2.3754  put_pixels8_xy2_mmx
12058     2.3399  avg_pixels16_y2_mmx2
12000     2.3287  mpeg2_decode_block_non_intra
8700      1.6883  avg_pixels8_x2_mmx2
7610      1.4768  avg_pixels8_y2_mmx2
6530      1.2672  mpeg2_decode_block_intra
6382      1.2385  ff_mpeg1_find_frame_end
5872      1.1395  avg_pixels8_xy2_mmx2
5625      1.0916  mpeg_decode_mb

The {put,avg}_pixels functions are in ffmpeg,
file libavcodec/i386/dsputil_mmx.c.  According to opstack output,
they are called by MPV_motion.  If I'm guessing right, these
functions are accessing the decompressed picture data.  Maybe
explicit prefetch instructions would help after all?

&gt;<i> Maybe there is something on the web how to measure the cache performance,
</I>&gt;<i> I'll have a look.
</I>
If you don't find anything, just collect some samples with oprofile
(and don't forget &quot;opcontrol --reset&quot; between &quot;opcontrol --stop&quot; and
&quot;opcontrol --start&quot;) and make repeatable and controlled experiments,
not modifying too many parameters (or lines of code) at a time.

As I'm writing this, I'm replaying the same portion of the clip with
DATA_MEM_REFS:7500.  I think it might be more fruitful to pay attention
to this performance counter, as it could reveal some unnecessary memory
accesses that do not happen to show up as cache misses.  Yes, here the
top 99% percentile looks different:

&gt;<i> So if also Nicolas joins the profiling we will get quite a nice sample 
</I>&gt;<i> of different processor/cache sizes :-)
</I>
I hope that the VIAllinen processors are supported by oprofile. :-)

&gt;<i> What video-out method do you prefer? I usually use Xv so my first step 
</I>&gt;<i> would be to use Xv, but on my new box the X11 drivers are not in a good 
</I>&gt;<i> shape. So maybe I will try DirectFB...
</I>
I prefer DirectFB, as my box tries to be a single-purpose box that can
be controlled by the remote control.  But I do have an X11 installation
that can be used if needed.  Anyway, I think it's easier to make measurements
when everything is in a single process.

By the way, DirectFB wasn't linked statically in my experiments.  The numbers
of samples logged for libdfb++ and libdirect were insignificant (about 50
total in the DATA_MEM_REFS case).  Also VDR wasn't linked statically,
because I was too lazy to dig up your patch for that.  For VDR, the top for
the DATA_MEM_REFS case looks like this:
CPU: PIII, speed 906.672 MHz (estimated)
Counted DATA_MEM_REFS events (all memory references, cachable and non) with a unit mask of 0x00 (No unit mask) count 7500
samples  %        symbol name
17894    29.8139  cDvbPlayer::Action()
8546     14.2388  cMutex::Lock()
5635      9.3887  anonymous symbol from section .plt
4879      8.1291  cNonBlockingFileReader::Read(int, unsigned char*, int)
4156      6.9245  cPoller::cPoller(int, bool)
3506      5.8415  cThreadLock::Lock(cThread*)
2983      4.9701  cThreadLock::cThreadLock(cThread*)
2881      4.8001  cRingBufferFrame::Get()
2386      3.9754  cMutex::Unlock()
2321      3.8671  cPoller::Add(int, bool)
1463      2.4376  cDvbPlayer::NextFile(unsigned char, int)

Total number of samples is about 17894/.298139 = 60018.  For softdevice,
the total is about 108722/.158219 = 687161, over ten times more.  So, I
think we can concentrate on libvdr-softdevice in the DATA_MEM_REFS case.

&gt;<i> &gt;You could perhaps also add explicit prefetch instructions, i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;__builtin_prefetch().  I don't know which processors have the opcodes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;At least the Pentium-M does.  But that would only help for reading
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the MPEG stream.
</I>&gt;<i> Prefetch calls are already used as far as I know (at least for the 
</I>&gt;<i> software alpha blending I'm sure), but as you already said for copying 
</I>&gt;<i> they don't help.
</I>
You can prefetch also for write access.  A cache line is something like
16 or 32 bytes.  If you're writing 1 byte, you will need to read and write
the whole cache line.  So, prefetching can help.

I've heard that some Intel processors have automatic prefetching.
Nevertheless, it might be useful to experiment with explicit prefetch
instructions.
