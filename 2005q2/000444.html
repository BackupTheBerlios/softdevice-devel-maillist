</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Stefan prefers the first possibility, I prefer the first.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The first too :-) ?, I thought the second.
</I>This was a mistake :-/ I like the second one better..
But I was about to give in since the most people don't seem to care too 
much...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Which way would do you like better?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From the packager's point of view, I think the second solution would be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>a little better (don't have to create two packages : just compile 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>everything, and let the user decide if he actually loads the player)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>But it's not that important, in fact...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I got my own extension work right now, DV camcorder access,
</I>&gt;<i> I think makeing a separate plugin like soft-IEEE1394 is the better
</I>&gt;<i> way as there could be separate releases independant of
</I>&gt;<i> softdevice release cycle. (OT shouldn't we make a new one 0.1.1?).
</I>Yes, I think we should soon release a new version. What about releasing 
a 0.1.1 on sunday? I would like to finish a few things and disable the 
debuging output before the release...
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So we get a bunch of plugins building the softdevice plugin family.
</I>&gt;<i> soft-player, soft-IEEE1394, ..
</I>And I guess we will get much more attention when announcing new plugins 
than just a new version of the softdevice ;-). Also I we could create a 
package which contains all soft-plugins.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>The real question seems to be : who will actually *not* want to have a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>media-player-capable softdevice VDR ? I mean, in the softdevice context, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>where you use the full-featured VGA card instead of the limited MPEG 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>output of the DVB card, will there be a lot of people not wanting to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>view Divx, especially since VGA output is *the* way to view Divx ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the additional plugins are more stable and have more features,
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps we can integrate them back (once we have something like ./configure).
</I>This is a very good idea!

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS:
</I>&gt;<i> The capability of my extension is:
</I>&gt;<i> 	- detect (report via OSD message) plugged and removed firewire devices,
</I>&gt;<i> 	- show live stream from DV camcorder,
</I>&gt;<i> 	- some simple camcorder commands like: PLAY, PAUSE, FF, FRew.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>This sounds like a very nice tool! Unfortunatly I don't own a DV 
camcorder, so I can't try it...

Bye,
Martin
