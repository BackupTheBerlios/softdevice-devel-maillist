<PRE>Hi all,

At times, my 900 MHz Celeron system used to use over 90% CPU in VDR, and it
would drop frames in busy scenes.  After some profiling, I was able to cut
the CPU consumption to 60-70% of the original.

Last night I did some profiling with oprofile.  I had linked softdevice
statically against ffmpeg (compiled from CVS about two weeks ago), so
I could conveniently see which functions are consuming most of the time.
I'm typing this from memory, so there may be inaccuracies.

The biggest surprise was color space conversion.  If I remember correctly,
there are three settings: I420, YUY2 and YV12.  One might have blue and red
swapped on my Matrox G450 (I think) card, but the other two look okay.
Until now, I had used YV12 (I think), and wasted some 20-30 percent of
softdevice's CPU consumption in color space conversions.  After selecting
I420, the CPU load dropped by maybe 20 percent.

Another thing, which wasn't so surprising, was that lavc deinterlacing consumes
about 40% of softdevice's time.  After disabling deinterlacing, I couldn't
notice any dropped frames.  I didn't measure all the interlacing options that
are available with libpostproc.

My /root/.oprofile/daemonrc looks like this:

CHOSEN_EVENTS[0]=CPU_CLK_UNHALTED:90000:0:1:1
NR_CHOSEN=1
SEPARATE_LIB=1
SEPARATE_KERNEL=0
SEPARATE_THREAD=0
SEPARATE_CPU=0
VMLINUX=none
IMAGE_FILTER=
CPU_BUF_SIZE=0
CALLGRAPH=6

I used the following commands as root:

opcontrol --reset # clear the event log
opcontrol --start # start collecting samples from the running system
opcontrol --stop # stop collecting samples

Between --stop and --reset, I used the following command as the vdr user:

opreport -l PLUGINS/lib/libvdr-softdevice*.so | less

I could also have used opstack and opannotate, but I was happy with these
function-level results.  I believe that you will need at least kernel
2.6.11 in order to use opstack.  OProfile is available also for 2.4 kernels,
but it is not included in the kernel distribution.

Try to view the same clip at the same position for the same duration when
repeating the test with different settings.  After opcontrol --start,
view the clip for at least 10 seconds, and try to issue opcontrol --stop
at the same point of the clip each time.

Of course, you can also measure CPU consumption with top, but the load
will vary greatly, depending on the amount of activity on the screen.

	Marko
