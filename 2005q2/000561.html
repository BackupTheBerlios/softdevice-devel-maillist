Now I managed to get a repeatable crash with one particular clip.  It could
be related to aspect ratio change (4:3 for the announcement, 16:9 for the
program) or subtitles (although it still crashes without the &quot;subtitles&quot;
plugin being loaded in VDR 1.3.23).

I also got some other crashes recently, especially when using the pause,
fast forward, rewind, and slow motion functions in rapid succession.  Maybe
libavcodec can be left in inconsistent state during these functions?

It's kind of funny and lucky that a crash of the player thread does not always
stop the recording thread, but today it unfortunately did once, even though
the svdrp thread was still running.  On Sunday, there was a crash during or
after unattended recording.  The recording was complete.

I can upload the repeatably-crashing clip to an http server, but I don't want
to announce the URL in public.  So, could the interested parties please reply?

By the way, the &quot;mute&quot; function does not interrupt audio playback or make the
sound completely inaudible.  Can someone look at that?

	Marko
