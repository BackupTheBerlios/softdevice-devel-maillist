I guess it is proven that the problems are not due to slow harddisks.

It must be something in the way vdr access the data, since the buffers 
of the softdevice are full, it is either like Torgeir suspects some 
interrupt handler which takes all the cpu time or some other process. 
Are you starting vdr as root or non-root? When vdr is started as root it 
uses real-time schedule policies, so maybe the problem fanishes if vdr 
is started as root.
What is the overall response of the computer during these &quot;hangs&quot;? Can 
you move the mouse smoothly? What does top show on (how many vdr 
processes are there and how much cpu time do they use?)
