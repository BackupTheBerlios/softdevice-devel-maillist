I've no major pending issues to fix. Just a short test with older
vdr versions (1.2.x) . So it's up to you to signal OK.
I would like thursday evening more, as it's just before berlios
mailing list breakdown. ;-( .

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So we get a bunch of plugins building the softdevice plugin family.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; soft-player, soft-IEEE1394, ..
</I>&gt;<i> And I guess we will get much more attention when announcing new plugins 
</I>&gt;<i> than just a new version of the softdevice ;-). Also I we could create a 
</I>&gt;<i> package which contains all soft-plugins.
</I>
Ack.

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If the additional plugins are more stable and have more features,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; perhaps we can integrate them back (once we have something like ./configure).
</I>&gt;<i> This is a very good idea!
</I>
Anyone on that list who has experience with gnu autotools etc. and volunteers?
Someone with html knowledge to polish up our homepage is welcome tooo !

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PS:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The capability of my extension is:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	- detect (report via OSD message) plugged and removed firewire devices,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	- show live stream from DV camcorder,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	- some simple camcorder commands like: PLAY, PAUSE, FF, FRew.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds like a very nice tool! Unfortunatly I don't own a DV 
</I>&gt;<i> camcorder, so I can't try it...
</I>
I've only one device, so I can't test what happens when one is playing
while another one gets plugged in.
