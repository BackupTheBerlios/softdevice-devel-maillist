<PRE>Hi all,

ok, here is a list of features that I'm currently working on or that I 
plan to include:

- playlist with album support similar to mp3blaster - almost done
- remove/add  files/albums during playback ( adding is already possible)
- shuffle the complete playlist - done (maybe I will also add per album 
shuffle a la mp3blaster in the future)
- .m3u support ( future )
- display cut down path in the title ( near future )
- saving of the softplay playlist ( future - how important is this feature?)
- reading and display of mp3 id tags (reading is already done by 
libavformat, but the information is not passed to the playlist - future 
- should one be able to disable this feature?)

Did I miss a feature request?

By pressing the red key during a playlist playback you enter a playlist 
display from where you can browse through the playlist, skip to a 
certain song and edit (not really yet) the playlist. The current title 
is automatically highlighted at the start and after some time of 
inactivity. I'm currently thinking about which keys to use during 
playlist playback, I guess it makes sense to use different keys from the 
single file playback (eg. movies) there. What kind of actions would be 
important for you to have a key for? Skip to next/last song? Skip 
forward/backward in the current song? Which keys should be used? 
Currently I tried to stick as close the what Klaus Schmidinger suggested 
  in the plugins manual, but a some things doesn't make sense for 
playlist playback.

Yesterday I rewrote the playlist support almost completly to get the 
album support, and now I've almost all features I already implemented 
the day before yesterday. I will commit these changes sometimes this 
evening.

Bye,
Martin
