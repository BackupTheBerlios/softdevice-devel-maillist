Hmm, from the logs you send this looks like the same problem that Thomas 
reported. I would like to ask you to do one of the following things (or 
if you like both...)

- What was the last version which worked for you? Go back in the CVS 
using the command:
&quot;cvs -d:pserver:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/softdevice-devel">anonymous at cvs.softdevice.berlios.de</A>:/cvsroot/softdevice 
co -D 2005-03-22 softdevice&quot; (replace the date 2005-03-22 with the 
appropiate date) and  tell us the newest version of the CVS which works 
for you, and the first version which is broken. You can find some dates 
you can try in the CHANGELOG. With this information we can find the 
change which broke the softdevice for you and understand the problem.

- Enable our debugging output. Edit the file mpeg2decoder.c and 
uncomment the lines //#define BUFDEB... and //#define MPGDEB..., 
recompile, start vdr piping all output in a file, and stop vdr after 2-3 
minutes. Gzip or bzip the output and send it to me in a personal e-mail 
(the list wont accept it because of the length ). If the zipped output 
is still more than a few hundred KB you can cut the end away. By 
enableing the debugging output you tell the softdevice to log almost 
everything with timestamps. From this output we can find out where the 
softdevice spends it's time and hopefully find the problem.


Thank you,

Martin
