I'd be interested in that patch.  The plugin.c code looked quite

Right, I didn't think about that.  It's quite different to code real-time
applications than interpreters or databases.

I believe that the granularity of usleep() used to be around 20 milliseconds,
due to some constraints of the scheduler.  Maybe that's why it's
busy-waiting.

Hmm, the disassembly in the opannotate output for cDFBVideoOut::YUV()
does not make much sense, e.g.,:

               :   1aa6c:       mov    %edx,0x4(%esp)
     1  0.0155 :   1aa70:       mov    %eax,(%esp)
   317  4.9185 :   1aa73:       call   1aa74 &lt;_ZN12cDFBVideoOut3YUVEPhS0_S0_iiii+0x3d4&gt;
    11  0.1707 :   1aa78:       mov    0xffffffac(%ebp),%ecx
    83  1.2878 :   1aa7b:       mov    0x20(%ebp),%eax

There are also some other call instructions jumping to %eip+1.
Maybe opannotate doesn't disassemble MMX instructions properly?

By the way, is cDFBVideoOut::YUV() needed for the Matrox G450?  Isn't the
card capable of doing YUV to RGB transform in hardware?  Or is it already
doing that?  I tried several runs, and this function is consuming over
40% of softdevice's time.  Hmm, it's pretty insignificant:
2764 samples in cDFBVideoOut::YUV(), 707906 samples somewhere in libavcodec,
1400 in libavformat, about 23000 in vdr, about 2000 in libdirectfb, about 100
in libdfb++.

Did you link all dependencies statically (i.e., ldd says that the
executable is statically linked)?
