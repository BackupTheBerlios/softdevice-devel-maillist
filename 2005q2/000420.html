<PRE>Marko M&#228;kel&#228; a &#233;crit :
&gt;&gt;<i>Crashes caused by bad signal a mostly due to ffmpeg, so they are less 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>interesting for us. Although we might have some bugs ( or missing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>checks) in our code too, which case crashes on bad signal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, such crashes affect the overall usability of the product.  I think
</I>&gt;<i> it's a design flaw to have assertions fail on garbage input.  It's so likely
</I>&gt;<i> to get garbage DVB data.  Next time when I get such a crash, I promise to
</I>&gt;<i> save the clip and to analyze it further.
</I>
Feeding softdevice with /dev/random could be a kind of test case... 
Maybe Martin's file player could be used for that.
I'll also provide recordings when I experience crashes.

&gt;<i> As someone suggested, using LinuxThreads instead of NPTL removed the hang.
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone know if this is a bug in NPTL, or just changed semantics that
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be accounted for in the code?  I have the impression that also
</I>&gt;<i> MySQL prefers LinuxThreads over NPTL, but I don't know exactly why.
</I>
There were long threads on the VDR ML (look for Rainer Zocholl, who was 
very active on this).
I think it's changed semantics, along with thread-unsafe code all-over 
VDR which didn't matter with LinuxThreads, but dead-lock with NPTL. 
There was a huge work on this around VDR 1.3.18 or so, but the problem 
is still not completely solved.
