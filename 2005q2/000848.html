Torgeir? What do you also have one thread which takes additional CPU time?

I don't know how good you know debugging tools, but if you know gdb,
could you try to attach to the additional thread and try to find out
what it is doing? (Basically it just call gdb, enter &quot;attach PID&quot; and
then &quot;backtrace&quot;. Vdr will crash after this, so you will have to kill it
with kill -9. Do this several times, and hopefully you will get the
position where the time is spent.)
The other possibility would be to try to profile vdr while playing a
recording with some profiling tool.
