</I>Sorry, I was in hurry when I wrote my previous e-mail. It's a bug, I 
just forgot to think about what happens in pause mode, so the way I 
implemented this now it's the expected behavior to blank the screen in 
pause mode. But I did not intend to have it like this and I will change 
it, it just need to make pause mode available to the video out class.

It would be nice to have a real power save mode for both xv and dfb-out, 
but there is also the case when softplay is playing audio only files. In 
this case a working OSD is quite important and I think a black screen is 
nicer than some old picture from the TV. Of course, in the long term I 
would like to have the ability to load background pictures from 
.jpg/.png :-).
So I think we should have both methods with adjustable timeouts, or the 
powersave mode triggered by suspending of the replay?
