<PRE>Hello all,

Before digging into the viafb code to improve the TV-out tables and add 
a 720x576noscale mode, I checked the various version available.

The version I had was :
* kernel 2.6.8.1 (Debian)
* epiawiki kernel patch, including the viafb driver
* compiled on 200410, IIRC

I wanted to compile a new viafb driver, along with latest kernel 2.6.11, 
to get any SkyStar 2 improvements available. Then start improving 
whatever TV-out tables I would have had then.

Available viafb sources, to my knowledge, are :
* Viaarena : latest 
<A HREF="http://www.viaarena.com/downloads/Source/linux-fbdev-kernel-src_20050203.tgz">http://www.viaarena.com/downloads/Source/linux-fbdev-kernel-src_20050203.tgz</A> 
for 2.6 (download comments dated 2005-05-20)
* open-source code from 2.4, updated to 2.6, maintained by Andre Kriehn 
:<i> <A HREF="http://patcher2k.012webpages.com/">http://patcher2k.012webpages.com/</A> (latest 2005-01-02)
</I>* code from the DirectFB CVS (to my knowledge derived from patcher2k)
* patch from epiawiki.org (also to my knowledge derived from patcher2k)


VIA : this lastest source won't compile with 2.6.11 because of missing 
cursor member in fb_info struct. This fb_info.cursor is missing in 
2.6.11 source but not in 2.6.8. I since checked that patcher2k 
viafb_03.diff simply commented out references to that member in the source.
TV-out tables are greatly improved with that source : structure is much 
more readable, they added something which ressembles a noscale mode 
(underscan, fit, overscale : respectively &quot;reduce the image to fit 
everything in the visible area&quot;, &quot;reduce a little less to set border of 
the image just at the border of the visible area&quot;, &quot;try to not scale at 
all, thus loosing some of the image&quot;). The parameters are better than 
the ones from 2004-10, but all include a flicker filter that blur the 
image (that's not what I want, so tuning of the tables is still necessary).
The driver includes a so-called &quot;accel&quot; mode for kernel 2.6 only, which 
might or might not include anything else than cursor acceleration.
dfbinfo/dfbshow are not happy with this driver, as if necessary 
acceleration hooks were not present (I don't have any traces since I 
didn't finish my checks).
Since patcher2k simply removed the fb_info-&gt;cursor references, I still 
have to try this code with 2.6.11 and be sure I didn't miss something 
when I tested dfbinfo/dfbshow.
Maybe directfb users can comment on compatibility between this driver 
and DirectFB. Maybe it could work along with cle266vgaio kernel module 
for 2.6 ?


Patcher2k : I still have to try this driver with 2.6.11, since it should 
work with DirectFB (I think that's the one I have in my kernel).
Since my goal is to tune the TV-out tables, and the ones in there are 
ugly, I don't want to loose time on deprecated code.


DirectFB CVS : I don't know exactly where this code come from and what 
is it's status, but it is said to work well with DirectFB. The TV-out 
tables there are also ugly.


Since the documentation around those tv-out tables is not available, the 
best source for future updates seems to be Via itself (also the 
Unichrome team have done a real good work at this for XFree, but the 
overall code is quite different).

I now have to :
* check if the Via code will ever work with DirectFB (including all 2D 
acceleration)
* if the Via driver won't work with DirectFB, select the most 
appropriate source for this driver (any advice is welcome)
* tune and maybe improve tv-out tables
