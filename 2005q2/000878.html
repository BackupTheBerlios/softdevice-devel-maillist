<PRE>Tommi Lundell a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Some times i want to look movies whit mplayer and/or use some other DFB
</I>&gt;<i> application and currently i need to stop whole VDR to do that. (Not fun
</I>&gt;<i> if you have some recordings waiting)
</I>
Do you use the DFB multi-application core ?
With that feature, you should be able to launch many apps at the same
time and display them on the screen. It is maybe useful to also suspend
audio/video.
You could also have problems with the LIRC stuff, which is totally
independant of softdevice.
I think your problem is more a good UI and ergonomics problem than a
software problem. Can you explain a bit more how you launch mplayer and
&quot;other apps&quot; and what you expect ?
On the other hand, you could leave mplayer alone and use softplay to
view other movies...

&gt;<i> So following functionality in to softdevice is very welcomme to me ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When i press example power button from my remote softdevice uninitialize
</I>&gt;<i> video and audio but it still left VDR runing. And when i press that
</I>&gt;<i> button again softdevice initialize audio&amp;video and start showing VDR's
</I>&gt;<i> output.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Btw. thx for that softdevice... it's great. Someday when all working
</I>&gt;<i> fine it's even better that fullfeature card :-) (Pic quality whit G400
</I>&gt;<i> is better that fullfeature cards and softdevice can handle HDTV
</I>&gt;<i> resolutions :-))
