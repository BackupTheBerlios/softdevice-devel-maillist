<PRE>I just got softdevice from cvs.  It segfaulted in
cPluginSoftDevice::ProcessArgs().  I fixed it by adding the &quot;continue&quot;
statement below:

    if ( !strcmp(argv[i], &quot;softdevice&quot;) ) {
        i++;
        argc--;
        continue;
    };

Also, I did some spring cleaning of my video clips tonight.  I think I
found a clip from February that crashed softdevice previously.  It now
played fine, except for some skipping.  I think it was simply bad signal.

Now the screen gets black when playing radio.  Thank you!

I've got some more crashes lately, with a CVS taken a couple of weeks ago,
right before the discussion on screen blanking.  The last one was Signal 7,
but it might have been because of replacing the running libvdr-softdevice.so
file (I doubt that, but it's a possibility).  A previous one was Signal 11
without any apparent reason, when pressing the Timers button on the remote
control, the first keypress for VDR's lifetime (during timed recording).
The sound output was turned off, so I can't tell if it was already crashed.
It was showing a stationary outdoors picture, but there might have been some
wind noise in it.

Here are the relevant log snippets:

CMD[1282]:Play
CMD[1405]:new Audio stream index.. old -1 new 1
CMD[1467]:thread finished pid: 3400 type 1
CMD[1477]:Neuer StreamDecoder Pid: 3395 type 1

CMD[5691]:Stop finished
(!) [ 3612:    0.000] --&gt; Caught signal 6 (sent by pid 3612, uid 1000) &lt;--

I think that the above was on Saturday, when VDR was shut down during
the playback of a recording.

[dfb] (re)configuring Videolayer to 720 x 576 (540x576)

(!) [ 2974:    0.000] --&gt; Caught signal 11 (at 0x3336393e, invalid address) &lt;--

This was probably the crash from pressing the Timers key.  I have to modify
my runvdr script so that it prints the timestamp also when starting vdr for
the first time.  Currently I have only this:

	date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S killing VDR'
	killall -q -TERM vdr
	sleep 10
	date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S restarting VDR'
