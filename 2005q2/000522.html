I tried without graphlcd now, and it's the same situation.

With this patch applied on on my checout from yesterday, the image gets 
very smooth, if it wasn't in slow motion and with audio skipping all the 
time, it might be well, but I can't really say so now.

I also noticed that on my 1GHz Duron, VDR + softdevice now only takes 
18-25% of the CPU, which is basically half it normally does on DVB 
streams with either mplayer, df_xine or even softdevice before theese 
latest kind of problems, so I'd say it's not gotten surprisingly double 
  as efficient due to some optimizations, as the image is only slow 
motion and audio skips all the time, but it seems to simply ignore the 
work it should do :-)
I will do a fresh checkout and try Martin's latest announced changes 
now, after that I'll probably go to bed.
