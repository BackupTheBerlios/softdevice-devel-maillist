<PRE>Guys,

I'd like to report my success with softdevice on my Eden powered ME6000 
mini-itx mainboard built on Debian.

The ME6000 is a 600MHz VIA Eden powered mainboard with CLE266 chipset. I 
was really interested to get the accellerated MPEG decoder going, 
because with a 600MHz processor I really didn't think it was going to 
work with a software decoder solution.

I'm using:
Kernel 2.6.11
DirectFB-0.9.22
DFB++-0.9.22
VDR 1.3.23
Softdevice-0.1.1
Streamdev-0.3.3-pre3-geni

and this is configured as a diskless (Actually, I'm using a 16MB flash 
card to boot with the custom initrd image containing the USB WLAN driver 
and then mounting root on NFS) client with a USB Wireless NIC.
Yes, I like pain, and this setup produced plenty.

DirectFB *does have* support for the MPEG decoder in the CLE266. It 
seems support for that function is growing rapidly now the VIA drivers 
are in the open.

Softdevice makefile was configured for DFB_SUPPORT, FB_SUPPORT (Not 
actually needed), and DEFINES += -DUSE_MMX. The output methods were 
built as a single library.

Note that PP_LIBAVCODEC and MMX2 are _not_enabled, they require 
instructions not available in the Eden processor.

Performance.
On the whole, great. I'm using a 17inch LCD monitor for output. Sure, 
the quality doesn't come close to that produced on my main VDR box with 
FF DVB card and 32inch screen - if you look at the 17inch screen from 
one foot away you can see some (not too significant) MPEG artifacts 
inthe form of blockiness here and there - but from usual viewing 
position it's great. This system is in my main bedroom at the end of th bed.

The majority of channels are just fine, with maybe a few high bitrate 
ones that are too much for the decoding (or other) process. On these 
few, the A/V sync moves apart over a period of some secods and a brief 
&lt;click&gt; on the audio is heard and sync is restored. The process repeats.

On usual channels with plenty of movement, say MTV, processor 
utilisation is maybe 60-70% for the VDR and associated processes. On 
high quality channels it hits maybe 80% and having the OSD active may 
make the audio stutter slightly until it's cleared. This all gives a 
load average of around 1.0.

I _may_ be being unfair to softdevice, and it _could_ be the WLAN device 
located in a bad spot. I have moved it since I noticed the dodgy channel 
(I noticed it on BBC News 24 of all things) and I haven't noticed it 
since. Just managing expectations if anyone else was thinking of doing 
the same.

Conclusion.
Compared to my previous installation with a DXR3 card? It's on a 
different planet! The DXR3 would crash at least once per viewing sesion, 
the OSD menus were slow and clunky, scrolling through the channel list 
quickly would almost certainly kill it.

With the above softdevice setup, the menus are, oh, so slinky and 
snappy, the remote is very responsive (as it should be) and the A/V 
quality excellent. Changing channels is somehow quicker too.

Thanks very much to everyone who developed or contributed to the 
softdevice plugin, and the DirectFB project. Excellent work.

Steve
