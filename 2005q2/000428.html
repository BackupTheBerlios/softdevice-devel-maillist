</I>
UTF-8 is something Klaus does not like. I also think that DVB did not 
standardized over it, and simply uses 8-bit character sets (maybe 
sometimes without even transmiting which character set is used, which 
poses problems in some countries).

&gt;<i> This is not the first time I encounter the &quot;we don't support that platform&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> attitude.  I think it's best to try to follow standards as closely as possible
</I>&gt;<i> with reasonable effort, and to test against as many implementations as
</I>&gt;<i> possible.  That increases the overall quality and helps to identify rarely
</I>&gt;<i> occurring bugs.
</I>
WRT NTPL, the fact is that Klaus does not support that platform. But he 
will accept patches from anyone who can provide validated ones. The 
patch provider will also have to be trusted, thus prove his skills... 
The required level is quite high here, specially since the problem to 
solve is very hard and Klaus won't accept to compromise VDR's stability 
in the &quot;normal&quot; case.

WTR UTF8, Klaus simply does not like it, and see the need to add many 
transcoding frontiers to add in the core of VDR. The case is currently 
&quot;let the user select which 8-bit character set he prefers&quot;. UTF8 would 
add transcoding from DVB streams, from and to files, etc. Many 
&quot;unnecessary&quot; steps (I regularly use UTF8, so I know what steps it 
involves when you have to exchange data with other systems).

&gt;<i> Well, excluding font bitmaps, VDR is only about 30,000 lines of code.  It
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be too hard to implement something similar based on softdevice and
</I>&gt;<i> budget cards like the Hauppauge Nova-T.
</I>
Well, that's still a lot of lines ! When I thought about what VDR really 
is, or what is could be replaced by (reasoning in terms of what 
libraries/programs provide the same core functionnality), I deduced that 
it's not that much (live TV = xine/mplayer, timer = cron, EPG = DB + 
scripting, recordings = xine/mplayer, OSD = the glue, etc...)
But the real value of VDR is the fact that it's expandable, really 
integrated, bug-free, has very few dependencies, has a strong community, 
attracts many developers, thus new plug-ins, etc.

&gt;<i> I'd like to have an easy to use
</I>&gt;<i> media station that allows simple DV editing and DVD authoring in addition to
</I>&gt;<i> recording, editing and playing DVB streams.  If VDR makes some inherent
</I>&gt;<i> assumptions about the stream format being MPEG, this may be too hard to
</I>&gt;<i> implement in the VDR framework.
</I>
Throwing the whole VDR just because the stream format is not expandable 
is not the solution.
Many people have ideas about improvements to VDR. I think the best bet 
is to wait for the 1.4 release and try to convince Klaus about some core 
things to add during the 1.5 cycle : some think about networking 
(multiple clients connected to a single VDR server), some think about 
streaming to anonymous clients, some think about handling more formats, 
some think about HDTV, etc.
I hope 1.5 will begin with a big brainstorming session !

&gt;<i> But then again, the DV editing and DVD
</I>&gt;<i> authoring are not needed very often, and existing software for those tasks
</I>&gt;<i> is probably much more efficient to use than what can be achieved with a
</I>&gt;<i> remote control.
</I>
I also wanted to do too much with my VDR : many things *could* be done 
with a remote/OSD, but some are much better with a mouse, a 
hi-resolution screen, and stable software.
