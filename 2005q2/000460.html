Sorry, what I meant was replacing all usleeps &lt; 10000us with 
usleeps&gt;=10000us. There are a few places where I just want to sleep, and 
I usually used usleep(5000), but this value turned out to be too small. 
It's the result of the profiling we did, but the effekt on the 
performance is small.

I like this method very much, for me it work really nice and I would 
like to make it the default method in the future.
I already have a testing version which contains the described changes, 
and the ability to skip frames if the cpu is to slow. For me this 
version works very nice.
But if you feel saver I can postbone these changes to after the next 
release.

This morning I checked my small todo-list and I found two more things 
which we probably should fix:

I get a compile error for DFB-out and DirectFB-0.9.21:

Is there a way around this with some #ifdefs (even if I don't like them 
getting compile errors is worse...)?

The second issue is not really a bug in the softdevice, but a bug in the 
XServer:


[softdevice] processing args
[softdevice]   argv [0] = softdevice
[softdevice]   argv [1] = -vo

These are the log messages:

When I discovered this I spend some time trying to debug it but I did 
not succced, hardcoded the default resolution and forgot about it.
The strange thing is that everything goes fine, and then on the XSync we 
get the &quot;Bad Alloc&quot; error which seems to be uncatchable.

Can we do anything to get around this? Maybe a ENABLE_HDTV switch?
