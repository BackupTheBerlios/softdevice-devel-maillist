<PRE>Hey,

My problem is that recorded files don't play smoothly. There's lots of
glitches in the video. Live TV plays greatly. I'm using softdevice
with DirectFB with mgatv output method. Here's some info of my system:

Software:

- Fedora core 2 linux
- vdr 1.3.23
- softdevice 0.1.2
- DirecFB 0.9.23
- ffmpeg 0.4.9-pre1, build 4748

Hardware:

- AMD Athlon XP 1700+ processor
- Matrox G450 graphics card
- IBM-DJNA-352030 5400 rpm hard disk drive
- D-link DWL-510 Wireless LAN card

Previously I had problems with live tv as well (while recording if I
remember correctly) but it turned out that DMA was not turned on for
HDD. I'm not sure is it fast enough even now. hdparm says:

 Timing buffer-cache reads:   828 MB in  2.00 seconds = 413.86 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   42 MB in  3.01 seconds =  13.96 MB/sec

Currently the /video partition is on ext3 filesystem. I have
considered trying ReiserFS but that seems to need kernel patching &amp;
compilation and quite a lot of things to do so I've been a bit
reluctant doing it if it isn't necessary.

One thing that might cause problems is that Matrox and SBLive seem to
use same IRQ. The problem is that I don't know how to tell SBLive to
use a different one. But I think that IRQ sharing isn't causing this
because I guess glitches should appear in live tv also.

Another problem I'm facing is that when vdr starts it looks every time
for a remote control. This means more annoying waiting in startup. I
have compiled VDR with options NO_KBD and REMOTE=LIRC because I use
lirc.

</PRE>
