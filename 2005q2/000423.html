If softdevice won't crash easily on entirely random byte streams, the
likelihood of crashing could be improved by making the stream look more
valid, in the spirit of this posting:
<A HREF="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/378632/2004-10-15/2004-10-21/0">http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/378632/2004-10-15/2004-10-21/0</A>
For instance, if there are any headers or trailers in the MPEG PES packets,
make them valid, but replace some or all of the payload with random bytes,
or insert, delete or transpose some bytes in the payload.

Thanks, I suspected something like that.  I'm not sure if I found the
discussion you mentioned, but I found a long thread where he participated.
This message from Klaus is a bit alarming, as he doesn't seem interested
in these problems: <A HREF="http://linvdr.org/mailinglists/vdr/2004/11/msg00778.html">http://linvdr.org/mailinglists/vdr/2004/11/msg00778.html</A>
Another thing that caught my attention when I installed VDR for the first time
was the lack of UTF-8 support.

This is not the first time I encounter the &quot;we don't support that platform&quot;
attitude.  I think it's best to try to follow standards as closely as possible
with reasonable effort, and to test against as many implementations as
possible.  That increases the overall quality and helps to identify rarely
occurring bugs.

Well, excluding font bitmaps, VDR is only about 30,000 lines of code.  It
shouldn't be too hard to implement something similar based on softdevice and
budget cards like the Hauppauge Nova-T.  I'd like to have an easy to use
media station that allows simple DV editing and DVD authoring in addition to
recording, editing and playing DVB streams.  If VDR makes some inherent
assumptions about the stream format being MPEG, this may be too hard to
implement in the VDR framework.  But then again, the DV editing and DVD
authoring are not needed very often, and existing software for those tasks
is probably much more efficient to use than what can be achieved with a
remote control.
