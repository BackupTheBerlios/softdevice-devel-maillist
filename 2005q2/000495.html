I could imagine that someone in Poland would want to view some Russian
channels.  The most natural choice would be Unicode.  Otherwise, Polish
would need ISO 8859-2, and Russian would need some other 8-bit character
set.  (I'm not sure if there are any Russian DVB senders yet.  I live too
far from the border to receive anything from there with a normal antenna.)
Same thing on Balkan: I've been told that Croatian and Serbian are
roughly the same language.  One is written in Latin characters, possibly
with some diacritical marks, and the other is written in Cyrillic alphabet.
And someone might want to view Latin, Cyrillic and Greek EPG at the same
time.

&gt;<i> WTR UTF8, Klaus simply does not like it, and see the need to add many

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;let the user select which 8-bit character set he prefers&quot;. UTF8 would

</I>
I think that the iconv library could be worth looking at.  It could be a
compile-time option, i.e., read/write the summary.txt in UTF8 and generate
file names in UTF8.

Later on, VDR could use Unicode internally and combine all the 8-bit fonts
to a single Unicode font.  Admittedly, that would be a lot more work, and
then the iconv library (or similar) would be a mandatory dependence.

&gt;<i> &gt;Well, excluding font bitmaps, VDR is only about 30,000 lines of code.  It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;shouldn't be too hard to implement something similar based on softdevice 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;budget cards like the Hauppauge Nova-T.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, that's still a lot of lines ! When I thought about what VDR really 
</I>&gt;<i> is, or what is could be replaced by (reasoning in terms of what 
</I>&gt;<i> libraries/programs provide the same core functionnality), I deduced that 
</I>&gt;<i> it's not that much (live TV = xine/mplayer, timer = cron, EPG = DB + 
</I>&gt;<i> scripting, recordings = xine/mplayer, OSD = the glue, etc...)
</I>&gt;<i> But the real value of VDR is the fact that it's expandable, really 
</I>&gt;<i> integrated, bug-free, has very few dependencies, has a strong community, 
</I>&gt;<i> attracts many developers, thus new plug-ins, etc.
</I>
True.  It would probably take at least a man-year of full-time programming
to achieve something similar to VDR.  The advantages of VDR clearly outweigh
its problems.  And as I can't contribute much programming to this project,
I should really shut up.

I apologize if my message offended anyone.  I'm definitely going to use VDR
despite its small shortcomings.
