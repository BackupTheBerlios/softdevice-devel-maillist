I tried again with up-to-date vdr and softdevice and recordings that I
believe are interlaced (many films are not), but didn't get the symptoms
on horizontal motion.  Those symptoms I got with live stream, which I
stupidly didn't record.

&gt;<i> &gt; One more thing: could it be that the composite sync of the Matrox G450

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MacroVision)?  The top visible lines on my monitor were shifted to the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and then output a very narrow and high spike (over 1 volt if I remember
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; correctly) a bit before starting to output the picture.  I haven't

Technically, it's not my scope, but I haven't had the transport to return
it, and my friend hasn't had time to need it. :-)

I'm not an expert, but the composite sync signal looks okay to me.  The
vsync phase takes maybe 15 hsync pulses, and the sync line is at mostly
GND level for about 3 hsync pulse times.  (It's an analog scope, and I
had trouble controlling the trigger.)

So, I can safely blame the slight distortion at the top of the screen on
the monitor.  On a second thought, I can blame it on me: The picture is
perfect when I put the &quot;VCR mode&quot; switch to another position.  On DXR3,
the distortion was much worse, and the VCR mode switch had almost no
effect on it.

BTW, I got the subtitles plugin to work on vdr-1.3.25.  I had to slightly
modify the patch in osd.c.rej.  Somehow VDR 1.3.25 can open nested OSDs, and
the hook for subtitles should only be invoked at the outmost level where
no OSD is open.  I notified the author.
