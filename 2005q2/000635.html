&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe keys from the DVD plugin should be the model to follow, regarding 
</I>&gt;<i> albums as titles/chapters in the DVD realm.
</I>&gt;<i> Am I right to think replaying will work for both audio and video in 
</I>&gt;<i> either mode (playlist playback and single file playback) ?
</I>&gt;<i> In that case, the left/right/up/down keys should remain the same (ie. 
</I>&gt;<i> resp. rewind/fastforward/play/pause).
</I>Good point. I was about not to have a rewind/fast forward function in 
playlist mode, and use those keys instead for next/previous file/album. 
But yes, the playlist mode is supposed to work also with video files.
What about the Green and Yellow button, they are supposed to skip 
forward/backward. Maybe I should use them for next/previous file?

&gt;<i> The DVD-plugin uses the numeric keys for title/chapter navigation. Could 
</I>&gt;<i> those keys be used for previous/next song, previous/next album, and so on ?
</I>Actualy that's one of the features of the DVD-plugin I don't really 
like. I can never remember which numeric key belongs to which function. 
Is there anyone who actualy uses these features and knows the keys and 
functions by heart? For me it's just not intuitive, but currently I 
don't have a much better idea.

&gt;<i> When the playlist is actually on-screen, the direction-keys can be used 
</I>&gt;<i> for navigation (down goes down, ie. select next song, right enters the 
</I>&gt;<i> album, etc.) OK can be used as in the channel-list view : play the song.
</I>That's almost like it is now :-) Expect that left and right a currently 
unused (I think vdr skips pages when pressing left and right, but that 
can be changed). Opening albums works with OK, but currently the 
playlist is always expanded in replay mode. So albums are only visible 
in edit mode.
Right now the playlist is always shuffled, but just because I didn't add 
a switch for disable shuffleing.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> User interface is difficult to make right,
</I>That's true ;-) For me the most important thing would be that one 
doesn't have to read through pages of manual to be able to use the main 
features of the plugin. It should just behave like one would expect, but 
what is it that people expect?

&gt;<i> current state to discuss it clearly. I'll surely have more to say once I 
</I>&gt;<i> compile your plugin, and actually see it on screen.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yesterday I rewrote the playlist support almost completly to get the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> album support, and now I've almost all features I already implemented 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the day before yesterday. I will commit these changes sometimes this 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> evening.
</I>
I commited my last changes to the CVS, now adding and deleting to the 
current playlist during playback is possible, but not really stable 
right now. Maybe I have to rethink the shuffle support, this makes 
deleting and adding really complicated :-(

Good night,
Martin
