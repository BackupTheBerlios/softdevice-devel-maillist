The opannotate command will show the samples for individual machine

Please have a look at <A HREF="http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/.">http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/.</A>  There are some
performance counters in every modern processor, and OProfile makes use of
them.  When you start it, you specify the counter(s) to use and a sampling
interval (the lower the number, the more frequently the samples will be
taken).  An NMI interrupt handler saves the samples in a buffer, and the
oprofile daemon collects the statistics and writes them out to a file.  This
causes a few percent overhead, and no instrumentation of the running programs
is necessary.  You can even profile kernel code, and you can start and stop
collecting samples any time you want.

Yes, the more samples, the more resources are consumed at that location.
CPU_CLK_UNHALTED measures CPU consumption.  I've also profiled some code
(not VDR) using DCU_MISS_OUTSTANDING, which measures data cache misses
(useful if you want to fine-tune things with __builtin_prefetch()).

&gt;<i> You can disable USE_SUBPLUGINS in the softdevice makefile and you will 
</I>&gt;<i> get at least one library for the softdevice.
</I>
Thanks.  I also see a dlopen() call in plugin.c.

&gt;<i> &gt;If you want to play with oprofile yourself, be sure to enable the following
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess if I find the time I will try gprof. I know it much better and 
</I>&gt;<i> we can compare the results...
</I>
Of course, this depends on what you mean by &quot;better&quot;.  Oh, sorry, I misread
you: you didn't say &quot;I know it's much better&quot;. :-)

I've used gprof years ago when there was no free software tool like oprofile.
(I didn't have access to Intel's VTune or DCPI for Digital UNIX.)
I have understood that gprof does not work with multi-threaded programs, and
I think you will have hard time using it in a dlopen()ed library.  Well,
actually the dlopen() might not be a problem, as long as all code is compiled
with gcc -pg.  For my doctoral thesis work, I wrote a program that generates
some C code on the fly and executes it.  I can't remember, but it could be
that it might actually have worked on the dlopen()ed code as well.

If you want to get meaningful statistics from gprof, you will have to disable
inlining, which degrades performance further.  Also, you will get junk from
the initialization and cleanup phases.

With oprofile, you can choose to collect samples for the interesting part
only, at a performance penalty of a few percent.  Already a run of 10 seconds
gives pretty good numbers.  The longer you run it, the more accurate it gets
due to the statistical nature of oprofile.  I'd let it collect samples for
a couple of minutes to get a pretty accurate view.  But isn't gprof somehow
statistical as well?

&gt;<i> Are the above oprof outputs from the old snapshot or from the new one? 
</I>
For the old snapshot.  I'll run the profiler again on a fresh CVS checkout
soon, maybe this evening.

&gt;<i> I guess I will try the subtitles plugin myself. I wonder if in Germany 
</I>&gt;<i> there are stations which provide subtitles...
</I>
I've understood that the bitmap subtitles (<A HREF="http://www.virtanen.org/">http://www.virtanen.org/</A>) are
used in Finland and in the UK.  In Sweden, they use textual subtitles.
You Germans are spoiled with dubbed programs.  Here, they only dub some
small children's programs and often in very bad quality (one actor tries
to imitate all voices).

If you'd like, I can provide you with some samples, e.g., &quot;Creature Comforts&quot;
by Aadrman Animations.  In tonight's show, all subtitles appeared to be
unsynchronized, appearing 5-10 seconds before the audio.

&gt;<i> &gt;Finally, I noticed another interesting thing: the subtitles will continue 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;change, even if playback is suspended!
</I>&gt;<i> Now that is strange... GetSTC should not return anything meaningfull if 
</I>&gt;<i> the playback is suspended...
</I>
When I suspend, the sound stops and the picture freezes, but the subtitle
overlay keeps changing.

&gt;<i> What I understand from the description is that oprofile simply checks 
</I>&gt;<i> what's on top of the call stack at regular (timed) intervals. That's 
</I>&gt;<i> more statistical than gprof, but requires no tooling of the code.
</I>
Actually, stack trace backtracking is optional, and it only works if the
program has been compiled with -fno-omit-frame-pointer.  I was unable to
enable backtracking yesterday, but I'll try again today.  It looks like
the default settings are stored in ~root/.oprofile/daemonrc.  It's a bit
of mystery to me if the settings can be changed once the oprofile module
has been loaded.  (It can't be unloaded from 2.6 kernels, if I've understood
correctly.)

&gt;<i> Ah, okay that makes sense. So I will try gprof, I guess it will be nice 
</I>&gt;<i> to compare with the oprofile...
</I>
Sure, and please tell me if you got it to work.  I have never tried to use
gprof on a multi-threaded program.
