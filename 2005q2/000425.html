<PRE>Unfortunatly the sofdevice mailing list was down again during the 
weekend and did not accept this e-mail. So here I send it again...

Hi all,

so here is the first version of my media player for the vdr with
softdevice as output device. It plays .avi with various codecs (if
supported by ffmpeg) and .mp3.

It should compile together with &gt;ffmpeg-0.4.9pre1 and  any recent vdr
version, but you will need the latest CVS version of the softdevice.
There is no chek for the softdevice version yet! So please make sure
that you checkout the latest version (from _today_ !) if you want to try
the plugin.

Have fun,

Martin

PS: Stefan and me have started a discussion wether to include this 
SoftPlay plugin into the SoftDevice while the mailing list was down...
Now I'm curious what you think about this. Basicly there are two ways:

-Include everything in the softdevice (only one plugin) and have compile
  options to decide what to be build.

-Seperate plugins: a softdevice mostly like it is now, and have a
  seperate plugin which implements the player capabilities.

Stefan prefers the first possibility, I prefer the first.
Which way would do you like better?

Bye,
Martin
