<PRE>&gt;<i> It must be something in the way vdr access the data, since the buffers
</I>&gt;<i> of the softdevice are full, it is either like Torgeir suspects some
</I>&gt;<i> interrupt handler which takes all the cpu time or some other process.
</I>&gt;<i> Are you starting vdr as root or non-root? 
</I>
I'm starting it as root.

&gt;<i> What is the overall response of the computer during these &quot;hangs&quot;? Can
</I>&gt;<i> you move the mouse smoothly? What does top show on (how many vdr
</I>&gt;<i> processes are there and how much cpu time do they use?)
</I>
I don't have a mouse so I can't try. Here's some stats from top:

live TV:

used CPU time:  ~40%
number of vdr processes: 2 - 4

replaying recording through softdevice:

used CPU time: ~50 - 70 %
number of vdr processess: 3 - 6

replaying through softplay:

used CPU time : ~40%
number of vdr processes: 2 - 3

Although I should mention that the test system is not the same as
before because I upgraded softdevice to the recent CVS on saturday and
vdr to 1.3.25 and ffmpeg to some other version. I say some other
because I couldn't compile softdevice with the recent cvs of ffmpeg. I
guess I should start a new thread about that  issue..
