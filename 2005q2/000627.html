<PRE>Martin Wache a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> ok, here is a list of features that I'm currently working on or that I 
</I>&gt;<i> plan to include:
</I>
Since you code faster than I think, I'll try not to forget anything and 
reply promptly !

&gt;<i> - playlist with album support similar to mp3blaster - almost done
</I>
Great !

&gt;<i> - remove/add  files/albums during playback ( adding is already possible)
</I>
Great !

&gt;<i> - shuffle the complete playlist - done (maybe I will also add per album 
</I>&gt;<i> shuffle a la mp3blaster in the future)
</I>&gt;<i> - .m3u support ( future )
</I>&gt;<i> - display cut down path in the title ( near future )
</I>&gt;<i> - saving of the softplay playlist ( future - how important is this 
</I>&gt;<i> feature?)
</I>
Important, as in : &quot;I really like it in XMMS/Winamp, but didn't yet find 
enough time to check if mp3blaster can do that (but mp3blaster stays in 
a screen terminal for days, rendering a save function useless)&quot;

&gt;<i> - reading and display of mp3 id tags (reading is already done by 
</I>&gt;<i> libavformat, but the information is not passed to the playlist - future 
</I>&gt;<i> - should one be able to disable this feature?)
</I>
One should be able to disable junk ID3 tags. BTW, when speaking of ID3, 
I also/always mean OGG meta-tags...

&gt;<i> Did I miss a feature request?
</I>
I'll have to compile and see by myself... Since I tend to KISS, that may 
be enough...

&gt;<i> By pressing the red key during a playlist playback you enter a playlist 
</I>&gt;<i> display from where you can browse through the playlist, skip to a 
</I>&gt;<i> certain song and edit (not really yet) the playlist. The current title 
</I>&gt;<i> is automatically highlighted at the start and after some time of 
</I>&gt;<i> inactivity. I'm currently thinking about which keys to use during 
</I>&gt;<i> playlist playback, I guess it makes sense to use different keys from the 
</I>&gt;<i> single file playback (eg. movies) there. What kind of actions would be 
</I>&gt;<i> important for you to have a key for? Skip to next/last song? Skip 
</I>&gt;<i> forward/backward in the current song? Which keys should be used? 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently I tried to stick as close the what Klaus Schmidinger suggested 
</I>&gt;<i>  in the plugins manual, but a some things doesn't make sense for 
</I>&gt;<i> playlist playback.
</I>
Maybe keys from the DVD plugin should be the model to follow, regarding 
albums as titles/chapters in the DVD realm.
Am I right to think replaying will work for both audio and video in 
either mode (playlist playback and single file playback) ?
In that case, the left/right/up/down keys should remain the same (ie. 
resp. rewind/fastforward/play/pause).
The DVD-plugin uses the numeric keys for title/chapter navigation. Could 
those keys be used for previous/next song, previous/next album, and so on ?
When the playlist is actually on-screen, the direction-keys can be used 
for navigation (down goes down, ie. select next song, right enters the 
album, etc.) OK can be used as in the channel-list view : play the song.

User interface is difficult to make right, and I think I miss the 
current state to discuss it clearly. I'll surely have more to say once I 
compile your plugin, and actually see it on screen.

&gt;<i> Yesterday I rewrote the playlist support almost completly to get the 
</I>&gt;<i> album support, and now I've almost all features I already implemented 
</I>&gt;<i> the day before yesterday. I will commit these changes sometimes this 
</I>&gt;<i> evening.
</I>
Many thanks for your hard work !
