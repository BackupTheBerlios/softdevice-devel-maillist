Probably yes, but I have been messing with the settings.  I just wanted
to show you how useful it is to run oprofile. :-)

</I>
As a matter of fact, I've considered replacing the SuperVGA monitor and
separate speakers with a Commodore 1084S (a.k.a. Philips CM8833 colour
video monitor with built-in stereo speakers).  I even bought a VGA
connector so that I could solder the SCART cable, but I haven't come
around to it yet.

&gt;<i> Is it possible to measure cache misses with your processor?
</I>
I guess so.  If not on the Celeron of my VDR box, I can play some recordings
on this Pentium-M and look for DCU_MISS_OUTSTANDING
(number of cycles while DCU miss outstanding; DCU=data cache unit) or
DATA_MEM_REFS (all memory references, cachable and non).
opcontrol --list-events lists all possible events, but I can't start up
my VDR box now.

&gt;<i> The reason I'm asking is that currently the softdevice decodes a 
</I>&gt;<i> complete picture, sleeps until it is to be shown, copies the picture to 
</I>&gt;<i> the video memory and flips the page.
</I>&gt;<i> The sleep between decoding and copying is asking for cache misses.
</I>
You could perhaps also add explicit prefetch instructions, i.e.,
__builtin_prefetch().  I don't know which processors have the opcodes.
At least the Pentium-M does.  But that would only help for reading
the MPEG stream.

&gt;<i> Apart from that for most boards / processors one frame doesn't fit into the 
</I>&gt;<i> cache.
</I>
Right, this Pentium-M should have 1 megabyte of cache, which is less than one
uncompressed frame, unless I'm mistaken.  The Celeron probably has much less.
