</I>&gt;<i> 1320     11.5475  cStreamDecoder::Action()
</I>Actualy this is quite interessting. Action() should do nothing except 
waiting for new packets and call DecodePacket() for each packet. I would 
not expect it use so much time. Sleeping and the call to DecodePacket 
should not count, so where does it spend the time? Maybe the mutex... I 
guess playing around in this function may give some improvements..

I never used oprofile before, only gprof so I don't now exactly what 
these numbers mean. What is samples exactly, I asume it is the overall 
cpu time spend in a function? Is there a statistic like numbers of calls 
and time consumed per call?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that the percentages are relative to that executable only.  But the
</I>&gt;<i> numbers of samples should be global.  So, even though cDFBVideoOut::YUV()
</I>&gt;<i> seems to consume a large percentage of CPU cycles, at 9980 samples it's
</I>&gt;<i> behind cRemux::ScanVideoPacket(), which has been sampled 11330 times.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It'd be really helpful to link the plugins statically to vdr, because then
</I>&gt;<i> the percentage figures could be compared directly, and also stack traces would
</I>&gt;<i> look more meaningful.  How can that be done?
</I>You can disable USE_SUBPLUGINS in the softdevice makefile and you will 
get at least one library for the softdevice.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to play with oprofile yourself, be sure to enable the following
</I>
I guess if I find the time I will try gprof. I know it much better and 
we can compare the results...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Okay.  Anyway, this will not be needed if you can figure out how to get
</I>&gt;<i> the timing right without using the RTC device.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I already tried using the sigalarm mechanism, the timing works nice also 
for greater sleeps times. Looks much better than usleep timing, also it 
is slightly less precise than RTC timing.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a snapshot &quot;softdevice-work.tar.gz&quot; from about 3 weeks ago, which
</I>&gt;<i> I guess I downloaded from
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.lucke.in-berlin.de/vdr-softdevice-work.tar.gz">http://www.lucke.in-berlin.de/vdr-softdevice-work.tar.gz</A> when the berlios
</I>&gt;<i> server was unavailable.  (It worked on Saturday but didn't on Sunday, or
</I>&gt;<i> something like that.)
</I>Are the above oprof outputs from the old snapshot or from the new one? 
If it is the new one then please check if in your old snapshot in 
mpeg2decoder is a function &quot;int cMpeg2Decoder::read_packet(uint8_t *buf, 
int buf_size)&quot;. About three weeks ago I introduced libavformat parsing 
into the softdevice and I like to know if the working version was before 
that or after that change.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The CVS snapshot I took on March 31 didn't display any subtitles.  I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> tried a more recent CVS snapshot yet.  So, I took the old snapshot and
</I>&gt;<i> patched the setup parsing code there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I guess I will try the subtitles plugin myself. I wonder if in Germany 
there are stations which provide subtitles...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, it could also be a problem in the stream itself.  I haven't seen
</I>&gt;<i> subtitles in any other DVB-T receiver, so I can't say for sure.  The
</I>&gt;<i> subtitles seem to work much better in softdevice than dxr3, where the
</I>&gt;<i> subtitles often appear in bursts.  However, sometimes the subtitles
</I>&gt;<i> could be one or two seconds too early.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, I noticed another interesting thing: the subtitles will continue to
</I>&gt;<i> change, even if playback is suspended!
</I>Now that is strange... GetSTC should not return anything meaningfull if 
the playback is suspended...

Bye,
Martin
