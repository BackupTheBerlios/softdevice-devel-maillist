Have a look at:
<A HREF="http://www.lucke.in-berlin.de/vdr-aspect-info.png">http://www.lucke.in-berlin.de/vdr-aspect-info.png</A>

But that would require a modification of vdr and will not work on Klaus
favorite FF-Cards, as it would need some fedback from the displaying
device &quot;hey tell me something about current stream&quot;.

&gt;<i> * what &quot;aspect ratio indicator&quot; is broadcast with the stream (if any : 
</I>&gt;<i> femon show an aspect ratio icon, but it's always 4:3 for my channels)
</I>
To my knowledge, all free private broadcaster do this in that mode too
here in germany. UK is opposite to that. Only ARD, ZDF and co.
(&#214;ffentlich-Rechtliche) transmit anamorphic 16:9.
One thing that could be possible is the some stations could
transmit aspect information via WSS. I know WSS is from analogue
TV, where it is transmitted on line 23. But guess what is possible:
Even on digital broadcasts the WSS information may be transmitted via
digital teletext streams ;;-) . I've never seen such a stream but dvbsnoop
is able to report them.

<A HREF="http://dvbsnoop.sourceforge.net/examples/example-pes-wss.html">http://dvbsnoop.sourceforge.net/examples/example-pes-wss.html</A>

&gt;<i> * reading the softdevice code, I understand that we can stretch and move 
</I>&gt;<i> the image wherever we want : is it really free, or are there limits 
</I>&gt;<i> (problems when streching more than the visible size, etc.)
</I>
As you've seen in video.c, there are no limits when it is done correct :-) .
Take an arbitray source region, scale it according to transmitted
acpect info onto the display region.

We can offer a free scaling capabilitiy. That was what I did first when
I implemented the adjustment according to the displaying device
(monitor, tv 4:4, tv 16:9, ..). But I decided to work with fixed values,
as this is easier to understand for average users.
