Could it be that the DVB stream places additional load on the bus,
causing the hard drive to wait for I/O slots and the processor to
wait for I/O?

You could also disable the &quot;input&quot; module of DirectFB as well, because
the keyboard can show up as /dev/input/event0 or some such.  First, however,
have a look at the title of the VDR screen.  Which remote control mapping
does it want to learn?

I had a similar problem when I set up my VDR box.  There seems to be some
locking issue that prevents softdevice from relaying the first remote key
event to VDR in learning mode.  It only worked once in 20..100 tries for
me.  I finally entered the mapping by adding some fprintf() to the
softdevice code, blindly pressing the keys, and manually editing the
VDR remote control configuration file.
