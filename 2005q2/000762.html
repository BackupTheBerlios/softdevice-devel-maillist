I have the same problem. This isn't a SATA harddrive, is it? I was
suspecting it might be a SATA controller/disc issue.

&gt;<i> Previously I had problems with live tv as well (while recording if I

See if changing readahead improves the situation. Try eg. 

hdparm -t -a8192 /dev/hda

This improves it slightly for me, but not completely.

&gt;<i> But I think that IRQ sharing isn't causing this

I agree with this. I can record multiple recordings at once with no
problems. (athlon 2500+, SATA harddrives, DirectFB/Xv output)

&gt;<i> Another problem I'm facing is that when vdr starts it looks every time
</I>&gt;<i> for a remote control. This means more annoying waiting in startup. I
</I>&gt;<i> have compiled VDR with options NO_KBD and REMOTE=LIRC because I use
</I>&gt;<i> lirc.
</I>
The DirectFB output method implements keyboard input as well.
