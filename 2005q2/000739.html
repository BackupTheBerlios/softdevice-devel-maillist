Well, I'm aiming for a simple device that will have four connectors:
to IR receiver module (+5V, GND, RC5 out), to TV card (+5V, GND, RC5 in),
to network card (Wake-on-LAN), and to mainboard (Wake-on-LAN).  Ideally,
I'd hotglue the circuit on the Hauppauge Nova-T card, but the prototype
will be plugged to the IR receiver jack.  That way, I can return the
card for warranty replacement if the smoke comes out. :-)

&gt;<i> &gt;Maybe this information could be passed to VDR by having the ATtiny12 send
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;manufactured &quot;unsuspend&quot; keycodes to the Hauppauge Nova-T IR receiver
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;port until an IR code pulse arrives from the receiver module.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can also input that information to the OS using the parallel or 
</I>&gt;<i> serial port : just set some line up for a long enough delay (1 min), 
</I>&gt;<i> letting VDR know why it was powered up.
</I>
True, or I could even input that information indefinitely on a spare
input pin.  The cx23882 on the Hauppauge card might have a spare GPIO
pin, but reading the pin would probably require changes to the kernel.
