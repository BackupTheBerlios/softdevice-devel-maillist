<PRE>Steve Brown a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Guys,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to report my success with softdevice on my Eden powered ME6000 
</I>&gt;<i> mini-itx mainboard built on Debian.
</I>
Great ! I knew it would work on that platform !

&gt;<i> The ME6000 is a 600MHz VIA Eden powered mainboard with CLE266 chipset. I 
</I>&gt;<i> was really interested to get the accellerated MPEG decoder going, 
</I>&gt;<i> because with a 600MHz processor I really didn't think it was going to 
</I>&gt;<i> work with a software decoder solution.
</I>
Since I use a Celeron 466 since a few years for software DVD decoding on 
Windows, it would have been bad if a new Eden 600 wasn't up to the task.

&gt;<i> and this is configured as a diskless (Actually, I'm using a 16MB flash 
</I>&gt;<i> card to boot with the custom initrd image containing the USB WLAN driver 
</I>&gt;<i> and then mounting root on NFS) client with a USB Wireless NIC.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I like pain, and this setup produced plenty.
</I>
You now have a (potentially ?) totally silent setup. I think it is 
really worth the effort.

&gt;<i> DirectFB *does have* support for the MPEG decoder in the CLE266. It 
</I>&gt;<i> seems support for that function is growing rapidly now the VIA drivers 
</I>&gt;<i> are in the open.
</I>
I'm really interested in CLE266 HW decoding with softdevice. I was told 
that libavcodec would make use of the HW decoding stuff, and softdevice 
would use it natively : do you have news in this area ?

&gt;<i> Note that PP_LIBAVCODEC and MMX2 are _not_enabled, they require 
</I>&gt;<i> instructions not available in the Eden processor.
</I>
Eden instruction set is different from C3/Nehemiah (kind of PII vs. PIII).

&gt;<i> Performance.
</I>&gt;<i> On the whole, great. I'm using a 17inch LCD monitor for output. Sure, 
</I>&gt;<i> the quality doesn't come close to that produced on my main VDR box with 
</I>&gt;<i> FF DVB card and 32inch screen - if you look at the 17inch screen from 
</I>&gt;<i> one foot away you can see some (not too significant) MPEG artifacts 
</I>&gt;<i> inthe form of blockiness here and there - but from usual viewing 
</I>&gt;<i> position it's great. This system is in my main bedroom at the end of th 
</I>&gt;<i> bed.
</I>
I sometime have perf problems (1Ghz C3/Nehemiah) when openning the 
recording list (directory scan), while recording a show, and viewing 
something else. The recording misses some frames and have a few seconds gap.
You might not have this problems with your NFS mount.

&gt;<i> Thanks very much to everyone who developed or contributed to the 
</I>&gt;<i> softdevice plugin, and the DirectFB project. Excellent work.
</I>
Thanks for your report.
