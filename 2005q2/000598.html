<PRE>Hi,

After I have read and I hope understood what you all did describe, I can 
sum-up thing here :

1) option to set physical display size
* use choose from &quot;16/9&quot;, &quot;4/3&quot;, even &quot;16/10&quot;, or so
* this is stored as a a decimal value : 1.777, 1.333, 1.6, etc.
* this may be stored as the physical H + V sizes of the screen (as X does)
* this option is selected once for all
* it is independent of the resolution of the screen : think about 16/9 
display at 800x600, or 16/10 at 1400x1050, or the new plasmas 16/9 at 
1024x1024
* maybe this option is already present in the standard config / DVB card 
/ video format option (from VDR's MANUAL : &quot;Video format = 4:3     The 
video format (or aspect ratio) of the tv set in use (4:3 or 16:9)&quot;
* display ratio, and display resolution can be used together to 
calculate the pixel aspect ratio : 800/600 / (16/9) = 0.75 ; 1280/768 / 
(16/9) = 0.9375 ; 720/576 / (4/3) = 0.9375 ; etc.

2) auto-detection of aspect ratio
* the WSS bit can be set by the broadcaster to set the aspect ratio to 
16/9 (I think the only time I saw it was with Arte on analog broadcast, 
because the TV switches to the full-frame display automagically)
* other auto-detect features can be used, to set wether the frame is 
meant to be viewed as 16/9 or 4/3 (or something else)
* if no detection is done (I don't expect anything here in France), the 
frame ratio will probably be advertised as 4/3
* this is something the user has no impact on

3) user-set programme aspect ratio
* the user may choose not to trust the broadcaster advertised aspect 
ratio (I won't)
* the user selects the actual image ratio inside the frame : 4/3, 16/9, 
1.85, 2.35, etc.
* the special value &quot;trust the broadcaster&quot; is simply the fact that the 
image fills the entire frame, whatever the aspect ratio (&quot;full-frame&quot;)
* that would be the option the user changes most often : the one to 
match to a remote key

4) match between frame ratio and programme ratio
* the match between frame ratio and image ratio is obvious : if the 
broadcaster says the frame is 4:3 but I see a 16/9 image, the image 
fills (4/3) / (16/9) = 0.75, leaving horizontal black bars ; if the 
broadcaster says the frame is 16/9 but I see vertical black bars, the 
image is in fact 4/3
* the calculations begin to be difficult for me ;-)
* this match is used to crop the image : strip black bars, the right 
thickness, at the right places

5) scaling between the frame/image ratio and the screen
* once the image is cropped by the match between the frame and the 
image, it can be scaled to the screen
* scaling uses the calculated image size and the actual screen size
* it also uses the screen aspect ratio, in another crop stage : fitting 
a 4/3 image in a 16/9 screen, or a 16/9 image in a 4/3 screen, can be 
done by upscaling of downscaling

It might seem complicated, but user action is limited to selecting 
screen size or ratio once, and selecting the proper image ratio, if the 
programme doesn't include it. That's something I always do on my TV (but 
softdevice will do this much better, not loosing resolution).
