</I>No, it is not unimplementable but quite a lot of work. The problem with 
the aspect ratio handling / cropping is that is it handled differently 
for every video out method. So one will have to change quite a lot of 
files and check if everything is still working for fb-out, directFB, 
vidix and X11.
In my opinion the better way would be to try to unify as much as 
possible of the four video out methods (eg, copying of the frames, some 
the osd, cropping ...)  and leave only the parts which are really 
different for every video out method ( like the initialization, 
allocating of the frames and so on) in the different video out classes.
Obviously this is even more work, but after doing this it is much easier 
to implement your suggestions.
In fact I planned do this unification at some point in the future and 
then I will certainly refer to you suggestions when implementing the 
aspect ratio handling. But please don't expect this to happen too soon 
:<i>-(, but maybe someone else volunteers to do this?

&gt;<i> Or is it simply just so clear and so well defined that everybody agrees

</I>I like it, the general idea is clear, and to me it makes sense. So the 
reason I didn't comment is a bit laziness and to the most part agreement :-)
