<PRE>Hello all,

I've connected my VDR/softdevice box to the TV (PAL 16/9), and have a 
few problems
with aspect ratio handling by softdevice vs. EPIA TV output size/aspect.

Hardware-wise :
* the EPIA M10k has a s-video output, driven by a VT1622 chip
* this chip receive configuration data from the viafb frame-buffer
kernel driver, upon mode change
* these data tables come from VIA, and have a few derivatives on various
files on the net (XFree drivers, viafb patches to the kernel, etc.)

TV-wise :
* with the tvoverscan module parameter, the output is adequately large
(there is really an overscan, that is the image goes beyond the edges of
the visible part of the screen, but I don't know how far)
* in 800x600 (not taking /etc/fb.modes into account), the image is
blurred by the anti-flicker filter : this is really bad, because VDR
does not need it, and blurring decrease quality
* in 720x576, the image is not blurred (the configuration data for this
mode might not have the anti-flicker option set : good), but there are
missing lines on the screen : about 24 lines (seems to be 600 - 576) are
not shown on the screen (the horizontal bar of the A is missing)
* I will check the viafb TV tables to tune them (remove anti-flicker in
800x600 or add the missing lines in 720x576), but they are very obscure

User-wise :
* I would like to have the video output of VDR covering the maximum
surface, not leaving blacks bars on top/bottom or left-right edges
* sat TV programs in France almost always have horizontal black bars in
the stream : a 2.35 aspect ratio is sent in a 720x576 frame, with 1/4
black at top and 1/4 black at bottom. Even 16/9 broadcasts have black
bars, that need to be removed when showed on the 16/9 screen

VDR/softdevice-wise :
* the pixel aspect ratio setting is something I don't seem to master
myself : I'm always confused by naming, meaning, etc.
* there are two setting : crop-mode and pixel format. This is not really
easy to find the right combination, and to change the setting when the
stream changes (not easy for me, thus undoable for the rest of the familly)
* the 800x600 ratio is not the same as 720x576 : 1.33 vs. 1.25. Along
with the fact that the TV is 16/9, not 4/3, I'm totally lost...
* the resize algo makes sure the whole image fit the screen : a 720x576
stream inside a 800x600 screen will never be wider than 750, even though
there are black bar on top and bottom

Questions :
* does anyone have already dug into the viafb TV tables (PAL 800x600,
720x576) ?
* is it possible to implement in softdevice aspect-ratio handling
something like &quot;maximize the size of the image&quot;, along with the current
&quot;make sure the image fits in the screen&quot; ? This way a scaling that
currently scale an image to 750 wide with in-stream black bar on
top/bottom, would scale it to 800 wide cropping a few black lines on top
and bottom.
* can the softdevice plug-in receive LIRC events to change aspect ratio
on a single remote keypress ?

I will provide real sample values when I have them (stream sizes,
softdevice logs, approximate useful image sizes).

(just an idea after writing this : the crop-mode has the &quot;none&quot;, &quot;4:3&quot;
and &quot;16:9&quot; options. Maybe I need a &quot;16:9 screen on 4:3 resolution&quot; vs.
&quot;16:9 screen on 5:4 resolution&quot; option, or this should adapt to the
actual resolution)
