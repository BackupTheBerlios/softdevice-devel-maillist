What I was thinking about to introduce at some point is direct 
rendering, i.e. let ffmpeg write directly to the video memory. That 
would save some time since there would be no need of copying the 
pictures any more, but I want to finish the audio things first...

&gt;<i> Thanks! Of course, a cleaner way would be to introduce a virtual method
</I>&gt;<i> void suspendPlayback(bool) that all plugins could override.  That would
</I>&gt;<i> have some chance of being included in some VDR release. 
</I>I doubt that a function like that would be included in the VDR. I think 
there was a discussion about this kind of function some time ago..

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now I tried the latest CVS on VDR 1.3.22 and 1.3.23, and subtitles-plugin
</I>&gt;<i> 0.3.7 (<A HREF="http://www.virtanen.org/vdr/subtitles/">http://www.virtanen.org/vdr/subtitles/</A>).  Unfortunately, I don't
</I>&gt;<i> see any subtitles with the latest CVS, neither from live stream nor from
</I>&gt;<i> recordings.  I updated only the setup parsing code from the CVS version,
</I>&gt;<i> and it worked.  
</I>Just to be sure that I understand correctly: before the setup parsing 
update the subtitles plugin was working and now it's not working 
anymore? Strange, that's hard to explain. Did you try to go back to the 
old version?
On a related note, does softdevice implement the GetSTC
&gt;<i> method accurately?  The subtitles plugin needs that for displaying the
</I>&gt;<i> subtitles at the right time.  (They are usually transmitted a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> seconds before they should be displayed, and now it seems that the
</I>&gt;<i> subtitles are displayed too early.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I thought GetSTC was implemented correctly, but I may be wrong. By the 
way I experienced an similar effect with subtitles in dvds, but I did 
not investigate it further...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Crashes caused by bad signal a mostly due to ffmpeg, so they are less 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>interesting for us. Although we might have some bugs ( or missing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>checks) in our code too, which case crashes on bad signal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, such crashes affect the overall usability of the product.  I think
</I>&gt;<i> it's a design flaw to have assertions fail on garbage input.  It's so likely
</I>&gt;<i> to get garbage DVB data.  Next time when I get such a crash, I promise to
</I>&gt;<i> save the clip and to analyze it further.
</I>I guess you are right. Every crash we can avoid it's worth working on it.

Bye,
Martin
