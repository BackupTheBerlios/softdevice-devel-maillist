Hmm, somehow I got some judder while playing a recording that was
perfectly okay with VGA output.

What are the symptomps of wrong field parity?  I got some wavy output
on the screen, i.e., vertical lines in horizontal motion would look like
blurry waves:

One more thing: could it be that the composite sync of the Matrox G450
TV output violates the standard during vertical retrace (i.e.,
MacroVision)?  The top visible lines on my monitor were shifted to the
right.  The problem is not as bad as with the DXR3, which omitted
horizontal sync pulses for several dozen lines during vertical retrace,
and then output a very narrow and high spike (over 1 volt if I remember
correctly) a bit before starting to output the picture.  I haven't
measured the G450 composite sync output yet.

Oh well, I may revert back to VGA.  It has problems with horizontal
scrolling and interlaced video, but at least the picture is sharp,
and I have no other use for the monitor.  Is there some easy way
to specify which directfbrc to use on the -Psoftdevice command line?
