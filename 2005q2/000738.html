<PRE>Marko M&#228;kel&#228; a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> I have another idea.  As I'm going to build an ATtiny12 based IR decoder
</I>&gt;<i> and wake-on-LAN trigger, I could monitor the system's +5V line with the
</I>&gt;<i> ATtiny12.  If the +5V line was brought up as a result of pressing the
</I>&gt;<i> Power key on the remote, we know that the box was powered up by the user.
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise it was powered up non-interactively, and softdevice should
</I>&gt;<i> remain suspended.  (Let's pretend that the power button on the front panel
</I>&gt;<i> does not exist or is not for interactive use.)
</I>
Than you got the hardware !
You don't have to monitor the +5V line, since the ATtiny itself will 
trigger the power-up, and will the only one to trigger an interactive 
power-up.
You can also connect the power button on the front panel to an input pin 
on the ATtiny, to also trigger the wake-on-lan and pass that info to the 
system.

&gt;<i> Maybe this information could be passed to VDR by having the ATtiny12 send
</I>&gt;<i> manufactured &quot;unsuspend&quot; keycodes to the Hauppauge Nova-T IR receiver
</I>&gt;<i> port until an IR code pulse arrives from the receiver module.
</I>
You can also input that information to the OS using the parallel or 
serial port : just set some line up for a long enough delay (1 min), 
letting VDR know why it was powered up.
