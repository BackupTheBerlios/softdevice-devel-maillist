</I>Sounds good. I never tried to do it until now but also my new AMD64 
seems to have this option, but I will check again. Do you have any 
experience on this? Maybe there is something on the web how to measure 
the cache performance, I'll have a look. I started to use oprofile, it 
seems to be a really powerfull tool. I didn't see any example on 
measureing cache performance yet, although it should be possible.

So if also Nicolas joins the profiling we will get quite a nice sample 
of different processor/cache sizes :-)
What video-out method do you prefer? I usually use Xv so my first step 
would be to use Xv, but on my new box the X11 drivers are not in a good 
shape. So maybe I will try DirectFB...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>The reason I'm asking is that currently the softdevice decodes a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>complete picture, sleeps until it is to be shown, copies the picture to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the video memory and flips the page.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>The sleep between decoding and copying is asking for cache misses.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You could perhaps also add explicit prefetch instructions, i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i> __builtin_prefetch().  I don't know which processors have the opcodes.
</I>&gt;<i> At least the Pentium-M does.  But that would only help for reading
</I>&gt;<i> the MPEG stream.
</I>Prefetch calls are already used as far as I know (at least for the 
software alpha blending I'm sure), but as you already said for copying 
they don't help.
