<PRE>Martin Wache a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Haveing a softdevice release which works without any problems with 
</I>&gt;<i> softplay would be good, that sure. On the other hand I think it would be 
</I>&gt;<i> important to have the HDTV buffering issues fixed in the next release, 
</I>&gt;<i> but that requires a rework of my patch. Unfortunaltly I can do only one 
</I>&gt;<i> thing until the weekend: finish the HDTV buffering patch or finish 
</I>&gt;<i> softplay.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I should only release a pre version of softplay this weekend and 
</I>&gt;<i> we can have combined softdevice/softplay release on one of the following 
</I>&gt;<i> weekends?
</I>&gt;<i> Or we release the softdevice this weekend without the HDTV fix, that's 
</I>&gt;<i> up to you.
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I guess I will first have to find out what's the cause for the 
</I>&gt;<i> time issues of softplay. If a fix of this requires a change of the 
</I>&gt;<i> softdevice releasing softplay alone doesn't make much sense.
</I>
My uneducated advice : release early, release often... 
(<A HREF="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html">http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html</A>)
Don't call a release pre-&quot;something&quot;. All releases are pre-&quot;the next 
one&quot;. The only problem with &quot;release often&quot; is the time it takes to 
actually release. Version number is not an issue : just increase, 
increase, increase.
I'll suggest the first version of softplay will be 0.1.0 (or 0.0.0 if 
you feel like it).
Bug fixes will be 0.1.x until new features or notable improvements 
occur, that will trigger 0.2.0 and so on.
Softdevice is really late on version numbering (or is in sync with 
softplay ;-) : I suggest a fair competition on version numbering.

(I have a lot of packages I made at work, numbered 1.6.13, 1.19.3, 
1.8.1, 1.6.16, and all versions were needed, documented, installed, etc.)
