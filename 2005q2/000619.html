<PRE>Originally, I was an unhappy DXR3 card user.  The card ended my pains by
letting the magic smoke out.

However, there was one thing that the DXR3 plugin or the DXR3 card did
better than softdevice: it blanked the screen after a short while of no
video, such as when listening to the radio programs.  (The state-owned
Finnish broadcaster YLE is phasing out DAB and going for DVB-based digital
radio.)  Could the softdevice plugin have a similar timer?  Blanking the
screen would save power consumption and the operating life of CRT screens.

Another thing, which might better be asked on some generic VDR list
(but I'm not subscribed to those).  Is there any &quot;standby&quot; key that
tells VDR to stop playback and to cut the inactivity timer to zero?
You know, when VDR is recording or is about to start recording within
10 minutes, it will refuse to power down.  In my experience, pressing
the power button won't reset the inactivity timer, and thus the computer
won't shut down 5 minutes after the recording has been finished, but
3 hours after the power button was pressed.  (These times could be
slightly different, but you get the idea.)  My VDR box powers itself
on and off by nvram-wakeup.
