I played a bit crash-me yesterday, I moved my antenna to get a bad 
signal and waited until the softdevice crashed. And indeed it payed off: 
I found a few places where I forgot to check pointers and one _really_ 
silly bug which caused a lot of problems on bad signal.
Now I can watch a station with almost no signal ( mostly noise, 
sometimes pieces of words, or parts of picture, or some movements 
nothing someone would want to watch) for more than a quater of an hour. 
There are still a few crashes which I couldn't track down yet, they 
happen in ffmpeg but the cause may be in the softdevice.
I will commit these fixes together with the HDTV patch (which I started 
to merge, but is not fully completed yet) hopefully on sunday, but I 
will send you an e-mail. So please update your installation to this 
version  when it's available before sending bug reports :-)

Looking forward for some more crash reports from you, and hoping that it 
will take long until you have something to report ;-)
Martin
