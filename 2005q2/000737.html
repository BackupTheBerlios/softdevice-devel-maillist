I have another idea.  As I'm going to build an ATtiny12 based IR decoder
and wake-on-LAN trigger, I could monitor the system's +5V line with the
ATtiny12.  If the +5V line was brought up as a result of pressing the
Power key on the remote, we know that the box was powered up by the user.
Otherwise it was powered up non-interactively, and softdevice should
remain suspended.  (Let's pretend that the power button on the front panel
does not exist or is not for interactive use.)

Maybe this information could be passed to VDR by having the ATtiny12 send
manufactured &quot;unsuspend&quot; keycodes to the Hauppauge Nova-T IR receiver
port until an IR code pulse arrives from the receiver module.

</I>
That's not a solution for me.
