</I>Unfortunatly I won't have much time to work on the softdevice until the 
weekend. So if we release on thursday I won't be able to do anything.

There are also some feature request which should be easy to implement. 
For instance the startup in fullscreen mode for XV. I tried just to call 
ToggleFullScreen() at the end of the initialising of XV-out, this works 
without any problems for me. So we would just have to parse the 
parameters and if full screen is requested call ToggleFullScreen.

Also I would like to implement some safety checks for the packet mode, 
and of course remove all usleeps &lt; 10000ms which are not needed.
I also thought about giveing the option of useing signal triggerd 
timing, but that should be tested before releasing it as default...
