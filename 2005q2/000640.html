</I>The decoding of the streams is done by libavformat and libavcodec, so I 
don't have much influence on how streams are decoded. Sofplay just calls 
libavformat and hands the packets to the softdevice which decodes the 
packets using libavcodec.
So if some files are not decoded properly this is most likely because of 
some limitation in libavcodec or libavformat. To check this you can try 
to play the streams with ffplay (the player included in ffmpeg). If 
ffplay plays these files without problems, but softplay does not, then 
it is really a problem of softplay or the softdevice. Currently I know 
only one limitation, softplay is only capable of playing YUV420 encoded 
files, but since allmost all codecs (specially mpegXX and divx) use this 
pixel format I don't think that this is the problem.
Softplay prints a short description of the streams on the console when 
playing files, what does this description say?

&gt;<i> As to the features I think the suggestion from
</I>&gt;<i> Nicolas Huillard regarding the navigation is a good idea,
</I>&gt;<i> important to me seems the possibility to switch the audio-streams
</I>&gt;<i> (of avi's).
</I>Yes, I forgot to mention that important feature, it is planned as soon 
as the playlist support has stabelized. Thank you for reminding me!
