<PRE>This may be a bit off-topic for this list, but I have built a simple 10A
power control box that has a switch (ON/OFF/programmatic), a fuse and a
solid-state relay.  The box is installed in an extension cord, and it
allows me to control the power of the outlets behind it.  The total cost
of parts was about 20 euros, including the material for the case.
A German company makes a USB controlled power outlet for more than double
the price, and the drivers are proprietary.

In the switch position &quot;programmatic&quot;, the power is controlled by an RS-232
handshaking line from the PC.  This allows the VDR to power the monitor and
speakers on and off as needed.  I would like to connect the relay to the
softdevice &quot;suspended&quot; flag, i.e., when softdevice playback is suspended,
the display will be off.

Here comes the hard part: When the box starts from ATX timer (nvram-wakeup),
softdevice should be initially suspended (and the monitor should remain
powered off).  Otherwise (box started from power button or wake-on-LAN
(triggered by remote control)), softdevice should start with playback
enabled.  Is there any way to find out how the system was powered on?

Last but not least, if playback is suspended, pressing any key on the remote
control should enable playback.  Or perhaps there already is a remote control
key for toggling the playback state; I remember seeing something like that
in the menu.

I lied a bit above: I've tested the solid-state relay (surplus stock
from 1981) separately using a battery pack as the control voltage source.
It survived the degaussing spike from my monitor, repeatedly.  I have to
drill one more hole to the case and connect the wires to get it into
production use.
