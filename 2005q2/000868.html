After thinking for some time about this, I think one should expect that
vdr/softdevice spents more time in libpthread when replaying a recording.
When playing live-tv the stream arrives at almost the same rate as it is
consumed, normally there is enough room to store the data since it is
consumed at the same rate.
When playing a recording vdr feeds data into the softdevice as fast as
it can. The softdevice sleeps in Poll() (just like the specification
says) when there is no room to store more data.
So in the end the buffers are full almost all the time when playing a
recording, which means that locking is more important there.

I'm not sure if this explains the 10 times more time which is spent in
libpthread, I would expect a bit more time, but 10 times?
And I'm sure that this _definitly_ not explains the additional thread
20-30% cpu time.
Which glibc version are you using?

</I>I second that, it would really be interessting to know if this is the
same for different decoders. What about xine? Maybe someone has a
running xine plugin?
