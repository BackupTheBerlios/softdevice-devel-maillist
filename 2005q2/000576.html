I'll try to think of a simple two-phase system :
* you describe your setup once : ratio of the screen, prefer to scale as 
wide/tall as possible, or the contrary, etc.
* a simple option switch between a few different possibilities, for easy 
scaling
My personnal choice would be relatively simple : scale horizontaly to 
fit the whole screen + scale vertically to fit 100% (4/3, distorted but 
the TV can reduce, or full-frame 16/9), 80% (or so, didn't made the 
calculation : to fit a 16/9 video with black bars exactly in the height 
of the screen), 65% (or so, to fit a 2.35 film with minimum black bars). 
I'm not so disturbed by distortion...
The current problem is that horizontal scaling takes place along with 
vertical, and a good vertical scaling is always bad horizontal (on 
800x600, but I'll probably switch back to 720x576).

&gt;&gt;<i> * can the softdevice plug-in receive LIRC events to change aspect ratio
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on a single remote keypress ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, vdr doesn't provide any keypress events to the plugins
</I>
Loosely related : is there a possibility for the plugin to switch the 
suspend state (not decoding) upon reception of a particular signal, or 
when VDR is doing it's EPG scan ? That would be useful to control CPU 
usage when nobody is in front.
