</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>I have another idea.  As I'm going to build an ATtiny12 based IR decoder

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Power key on the remote, we know that the box was powered up by the user.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Otherwise it was powered up non-interactively, and softdevice should
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>remain suspended.  (Let's pretend that the power button on the front panel
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>does not exist or is not for interactive use.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Than you got the hardware !
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>You don't have to monitor the +5V line, since the ATtiny itself will 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>trigger the power-up, and will the only one to trigger an interactive 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>power-up.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>You can also connect the power button on the front panel to an input pin 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>on the ATtiny, to also trigger the wake-on-lan and pass that info to the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I'm aiming for a simple device that will have four connectors:
</I>&gt;<i> to IR receiver module (+5V, GND, RC5 out), to TV card (+5V, GND, RC5 in),
</I>&gt;<i> to network card (Wake-on-LAN), and to mainboard (Wake-on-LAN).  Ideally,
</I>&gt;<i> I'd hotglue the circuit on the Hauppauge Nova-T card, but the prototype
</I>&gt;<i> will be plugged to the IR receiver jack.  That way, I can return the
</I>&gt;<i> card for warranty replacement if the smoke comes out. :-)
</I>
Do you know the Wake-on-LIRC project ? (<A HREF="http://markh.de/wakeonlirc/">http://markh.de/wakeonlirc/</A>)
I thought you were using it, thus induced you were in the same setup 
(custom IR receiver connected to serial and wol : no 
proprietary/specific connector or driver, just plain serial).
Wake-on-LIRC is GPL, so you could hack it to make it work as you like 
(and everyone could benefit, regardless of the DVB card used ;-) ).

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Maybe this information could be passed to VDR by having the ATtiny12 send
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>manufactured &quot;unsuspend&quot; keycodes to the Hauppauge Nova-T IR receiver
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>port until an IR code pulse arrives from the receiver module.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>You can also input that information to the OS using the parallel or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>serial port : just set some line up for a long enough delay (1 min), 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>letting VDR know why it was powered up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> True, or I could even input that information indefinitely on a spare
</I>&gt;<i> input pin.  The cx23882 on the Hauppauge card might have a spare GPIO
</I>&gt;<i> pin, but reading the pin would probably require changes to the kernel.
</I>
owfs, using the 1-wire chips, would have provided a really easy way to 
ask the chips what happenned (using the alarm bit inside the chip, 
accessed with a simple cat command), and connect everything to a single 
serial or USB port (IR trigger + solid-state relay + whatever you want 
and don't even need, like temperature sensor, rpm counter for your fan 
or power meter).
For those who don't know that yet : <A HREF="http://owfs.sourceforge.net/">http://owfs.sourceforge.net/</A>
