</I>As Torgeir already said, this is a known problem, I think you are the
third one to report it.
It would be really nice to find the reason for these troubles,
unfortunatly on my box I don't see them, so for me it is impossible to
find out more....

Currently I know the following:
1. one of vdr's threads takes much more cpu time on the affected systems
   (this is the thread which feeds the data to the softdevice)
2. when replaying a recording the buffers of the softdevice are usually
   full. This is because vdr feeds data as fast as it can since vdr
   doesn't know how fast it will be consumed.
So my current guess is that something (either the softdevice or vdr)
busy waits because of the full buffers. No idea why or where....

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I added little timing debug to code.
</I>&gt;<i> mpeg2decoder.c
</I>&gt;<i> Line 594:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   // display picture
</I>&gt;<i>    delay2=syncTimer2-&gt;GetRelTime();
</I>&gt;<i>    printf(&quot;decode = %d\t&quot;,delay2);
</I>&gt;<i>    videoOut-&gt;YUV(picture-&gt;data[0], picture-&gt;data[1],picture-&gt;data[2],
</I>&gt;<i>        context-&gt;width,context-&gt;height,
</I>&gt;<i>        picture-&gt;linesize[0],picture-&gt;linesize[1]);
</I>&gt;<i>    delay2+=syncTimer2-&gt;GetRelTime();
</I>&gt;<i>    printf(&quot;Total = %d\n&quot;,delay2);
</I>

&gt;<i> It's seems that problem is somewhere mpeg2 stream decoding part but i
</I>&gt;<i> can be wrong also ;-)

Your debuging code is a bit simple, it cannot decide if it's really in
the decoding or in the buffering somewhere.
If you really want to debug this, you should enable the BUFDEB debugging
macro, which gives you a lot of debugging information together with the
times, pipe the output into a file since it quite a lot. You could can
compare the output of live tv with the output of a replay, and keep in
mind that the softdevice is multithreaded. I said &quot;if you really want to
debug this&quot;, because I think trying to understand the logs will be very
difficult since you need to understand fully how all the threads of the
softdevice and vdr work together. But if you are willing to try, don't
hesitate to ask if you don't understand something. Note that you won't
find the reason with this method if it is in vdr.

The other possibility would be to profile the softdevice playing a
recording and live-tv and compare where the softdevice or vdr spents the
time. I guess oprofile would be the best profiler for this since gprof
doesn't like threads and shared librarys...
I think the second possiblity is the better one, but unfortunatly I'm
still no expert of oprofile, so I can't help you much there...


Bye,
Martin
