</I>The problem here is that currently there is now way for the softdevice 
to tell if it is playing a recording or live - tv. I think we could use 
cStatus (or whatever it is called) but actually I have never checked.
When the softdevice enters pause mode during playback of a recording it 
just doesn't accept any data any more, this is not possible during 
live-tv, vdr will complain a lot about buffer overflows.
So we need to know if we are playing a recording or live-tv and 
currently I don't know an appropriate way to get to know that. Using 
cStatus I don't like very much for two reasons: I think it is not meant 
to be used for this, and as far as I remember it is a quite recent 
feature so it won't work for all vdr versions.
If you find an simple and reliable way to distinguish replaying of a 
recording and live-tv, pausing the recording during suspend is no 
problem ;-)
