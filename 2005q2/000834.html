There seems to be one process that takes 30 - 40 % and another that
takes 20 - 30 % and the rest take under 10 %. So indeed, there seems
to be a process that eats quite a lot cpu time.

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Although I should mention that the test system is not the same as

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guess I should start a new thread about that  issue..
</I>&gt;<i> Did this change the behavior when replaying a recording?
</I>
I don't think that it had any major improvements. But now I can test
with a new version of ffmpeg, thank you for the fix!
