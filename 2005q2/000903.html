<PRE>Quoting &quot;A.O.&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/softdevice-devel">ospite at studenti.unina.it</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it seems i was able to solve the problem i had when going in and
</I>&gt;<i> out of fullscreen mode very fast. The effect was that from time to time
</I>&gt;<i> vdr stopped because of a buffering problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I commented the call that sets the window Focus explicitly in
</I>&gt;<i> xv-video.c, now the focus handling is demanded to the windows manager (i
</I>&gt;<i> use blackbox, and my videocard is a savage IX/MX ARGH!). But.. there is
</I>&gt;<i> always a &quot;but&quot;, playing insanely with the f-key now brings to another
</I>&gt;<i> issue: sometimes when coming back to windowed mode the window size is
</I>&gt;<i> not restored properly, the window seems to have the correct position but
</I>&gt;<i> it has the &quot;fullscreen&quot; size. Maybe a locking problem? Should
</I>&gt;<i> softdevice allow a fullscreen request when serving a fullscreen request?
</I>
Noticed that too when holding 'f' key, so that toggling is done at keyrepeat rate.
Perhaps we have to ignore (count) toggle request until we get the corresponding
ConfigureNotify event. I guess that counting toggle requests should solve
your initial problem too.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The attached patch needs to be tested on other setups, i presume.
</I>
Setting input focus explicit is required for some window managers.
Changing the toggle code, requires test on at least several (five+) WMs
gnome, kde, windowmaker, .. .

Sorry but for that reason: patch rejected.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Moreover, i noticed another odd behaviour (but i can live with that for
</I>&gt;<i> now): when i move the softdevice window, if i keep the titlebar grabbed
</I>&gt;<i> without releasing it for a while, the decodig thread seems to going mad.
</I>&gt;<i> Please, can anyone else experiment this?
</I>
That is: no video update during that action ?
I think thats a window manager issue. As far as I remember, mwm acts in
a similar sane way upon resize events. Blocking events until the resize
action complets :-( .

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks, softdevice is now usable on my crappy thinkpad :)
</I>&gt;<i>
