<PRE>Leo M&#225;rquez a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Hi again,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that my problem is with my /etc/directfbrc. I haven't touch it.
</I>&gt;<i> I have connected the epia s-video to a Tv and I see ok the console. But 
</I>&gt;<i> when I do modprobe viafb I lost the image and see white lines. I have 
</I>&gt;<i> taked a look to the epia bios and no see the option LCD+TV (i have a lcd 
</I>&gt;<i> 15&quot; monitor and my TV).
</I>
The BIOS option would have enabled the TV-out at boot-up. There is also 
an auto-detect feature in the VT1622 chip, that can activate TV-out when 
a TV is actually connected. I think I've upgraded the BIOS of my board, 
and maybe that option appeared at that time.
So : you're OK on the BIOS front.

&gt;<i> Then I can't probe the two outputs at same time.
</I>
Did you pass the TV-out parameter when loading the viafb module ? When 
you load it, it overrides the BIOS defaults, and may activate a wrong setup.
My modprobe is (for kernel 2.6):

modprobe viafb mode=720x576 bpp=32 refresh=50 TVon=1 TVoverscan=1

This *may* relies on /etc/fb.modes, where I have :

mode &quot;720x576-74&quot;
     # D: 41.475 MHz, H: 44.693 kHz, V: 74.488 Hz
     geometry 720 576 720 1152 32
     timings 24111 88 32 16 4 88 4
     rgba 8/16,8/8,8/0,8/24
endmode

DirectFB tests will also rely on /etc/directfbrc :

mode=720x576
depth=32
pixelformat=ARGB
disable-module=lirc
disable-module=joystick
disable-module=cle266
no-vt

&gt;<i> I understand I have to set up the /etc/directfbrc file with corrects 
</I>&gt;<i> values to see VDR in my lcd or TV.
</I>
Only modprobe params are used to set output device type (TV and/or VGA). 
frame-buffer manipulation programs also rely on /etc/fb.modes (timings, 
geometry). Maybe differing options will make TV out useless.
All those stuff are still a bit unclear for me, and also a little buggy...

&gt;<i> How can I know this values for my TV? For the LCD I supose that any 
</I>&gt;<i> habitual resolution works (1024x768 for example).
</I>
TV-out mist work only if you set TVon=1 on the modprobe line (add maybe 
also TVtype et al. : check those options), *and* the selected mode have 
a TV-out settings ready-made (1024x768 works, 800x600 also, some modes 
work only in PAL, others only in NTSC, many in both). This may also only 
work if the /etc/fb.modes have right timings.

&gt;<i> Now I'm at work and I don't know that I have in /etc/directfbrc and 
</I>&gt;<i> can't probe it.
</I>&gt;<i> Any additional orientation to my suppositions will be thanked for.
</I>
The viafb tarball from viaarena contains a fb.modes file with mode 
sections that could work better than mine (they do not work better in my 
case, though).
