Thanks for your answer.
First of all : I referred to 0.1.1 (and still refers to it, until I 
update). You maybe already did something, so please forgive me if I 
didn't see it yet.
Next : I don't really know what have to be modified. This was just a 
first-try full-spec.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>After I have read and I hope understood what you all did describe, I can 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>sum-up thing here :
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>1) option to set physical display size
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* use choose from &quot;16/9&quot;, &quot;4/3&quot;, even &quot;16/10&quot;, or so
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* this is stored as a a decimal value : 1.777, 1.333, 1.6, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* this may be stored as the physical H + V sizes of the screen (as X does)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* this option is selected once for all
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* it is independent of the resolution of the screen : think about 16/9 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>display at 800x600, or 16/10 at 1400x1050, or the new plasmas 16/9 at 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>1024x1024
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* maybe this option is already present in the standard config / DVB card 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>/ video format option (from VDR's MANUAL : &quot;Video format = 4:3     The 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>video format (or aspect ratio) of the tv set in use (4:3 or 16:9)&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* display ratio, and display resolution can be used together to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>calculate the pixel aspect ratio : 800/600 / (16/9) = 0.75 ; 1280/768 / 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>(16/9) = 0.9375 ; 720/576 / (4/3) = 0.9375 ; etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Most of that is done. We have an option to select the output geometry.
</I>&gt;<i> - Monitor (with square pixels)
</I>&gt;<i> - TV 4:3 non square pixel.
</I>&gt;<i> - TV 16:9 non square pixel.
</I>&gt;<i> and some other. What is missing is an arbitray user selectable ratio.
</I>
That's it.
TV aspect ratio in 0.1.1 is in fact resolution selection. Thus selecting 
TV 16:9 with a 800x600 mode does not yield the same result as selecting 
the same with a 720x576 mode.
But the TV didn't change, and it's ratio didn't change. Think about a 
16:9 plasma with a native 1024x1024 grid. It's still 16:9, and the 
output should be the same.
That change might be easy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>2) auto-detection of aspect ratio
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* the WSS bit can be set by the broadcaster to set the aspect ratio to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>16/9 (I think the only time I saw it was with Arte on analog broadcast, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>because the TV switches to the full-frame display automagically)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* other auto-detect features can be used, to set wether the frame is 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>meant to be viewed as 16/9 or 4/3 (or something else)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* if no detection is done (I don't expect anything here in France), the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>frame ratio will probably be advertised as 4/3
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* this is something the user has no impact on
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I see here no TODO.
</I>
I can't really say. I think I didn't ever see actual auto-detection, 
since everything is broadcast the same (bad) way in France.
That one is really for completeness.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>3) user-set programme aspect ratio
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* the user may choose not to trust the broadcaster advertised aspect 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>ratio (I won't)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* the user selects the actual image ratio inside the frame : 4/3, 16/9, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>1.85, 2.35, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* the special value &quot;trust the broadcaster&quot; is simply the fact that the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>image fills the entire frame, whatever the aspect ratio (&quot;full-frame&quot;)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* that would be the option the user changes most often : the one to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>match to a remote key
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> User can override broadcasters setting. for dfb and xv, which have
</I>&gt;<i> their own remotes, this can be mapped to a user key. This is
</I>&gt;<i> implemented, no TODO.
</I>
I'll check that in CVS.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>4) match between frame ratio and programme ratio
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* the match between frame ratio and image ratio is obvious : if the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>broadcaster says the frame is 4:3 but I see a 16/9 image, the image 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>fills (4/3) / (16/9) = 0.75, leaving horizontal black bars ; if the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>broadcaster says the frame is 16/9 but I see vertical black bars, the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>image is in fact 4/3
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* the calculations begin to be difficult for me ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* this match is used to crop the image : strip black bars, the right 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>thickness, at the right places
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thats to my opinion a variant of 3.): let the user say it's 4:3 or
</I>&gt;<i> 16:9 or trust the broad caster. no TODO.
</I>
This is not a variant, just the consequence of the previous : select the 
show aspect ratio (2 or 3), then fit the show in the screen (4). Maybe 
my explanation is a bit too separated in steps.
2 or 3 is a way to add aspect ratio information to the show (automatic 
vs. manual). 4 does the calculation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>5) scaling between the frame/image ratio and the screen
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* once the image is cropped by the match between the frame and the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>image, it can be scaled to the screen
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* scaling uses the calculated image size and the actual screen size
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>* it also uses the screen aspect ratio, in another crop stage : fitting 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>a 4/3 image in a 16/9 screen, or a 16/9 image in a 4/3 screen, can be 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>done by upscaling of downscaling
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also a variant of 3.) . We can map a 4:3 image with cropping to a 16:9
</I>&gt;<i> screen without black boardes. No TODO.
</I>
Same answer : my explanation was a bit too stepped.

To summarize :
1) select the screen ratio once (not screen resolution, just ratio)
2, 3) select the show ratio (automatic vs. user-selected, preferably 
using the remote)
4) eliminate black bars by cropping, based on 1 and 2-3
5) scale to satisfy the once-set user preferences (loose parts of the 
image by zooming-in, or scale to fit the whole screen, or don't destroy 
aspect ratio or image size by adding black bars)

It's a bit late : I'll draw ASCII art another day...

&gt;<i> What could be done is: let the user select/define a zoom region
</I>&gt;<i> of the current video (show F1 split screen advertising/race as
</I>&gt;<i> zoomed race only :-) ).
</I>
Don't go too far. I already have problems with my wife when I toggle 
between the 4 zoom modes of the TV to find the right one... so selecting 
a screen region with the remote before zooming would be a bit to much 
for her patience...
