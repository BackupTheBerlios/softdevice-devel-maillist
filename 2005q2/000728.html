</I>Maybe we should write somewhere that people should use I420 if possible 
(it is the native colorspace for mpeg2). YV12 is only there for people 
owning a graphics card which can't do I420 or YUV2. But I think 
I420/YUV2 is the default, or am I wrong?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another thing, which wasn't so surprising, was that lavc deinterlacing consumes

</I>Hmm, isn't no deinterlacing also the default?
I guess you don't even need deintelacing because the Matrox can do it in 
hardware ;-)

Probably we should check again the default settings and write a short 
description about the options somewhere in the Readme.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My /root/.oprofile/daemonrc looks like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> CHOSEN_EVENTS[0]=CPU_CLK_UNHALTED:90000:0:1:1
</I>&gt;<i> NR_CHOSEN=1
</I>&gt;<i> SEPARATE_LIB=1
</I>&gt;<i> SEPARATE_KERNEL=0
</I>&gt;<i> SEPARATE_THREAD=0

</I>&gt;<i> VMLINUX=none
</I>&gt;<i> IMAGE_FILTER=

</I>&gt;<i> CALLGRAPH=6
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Is it possible to measure cache misses with your processor?
The reason I'm asking is that currently the softdevice decodes a 
complete picture, sleeps until it is to be shown, copies the picture to 
the video memory and flips the page.
The sleep between decoding and copying is asking for cache misses. Apart 
from that for most boards / processors one frame doesn't fit into the 
cache. Fortunatly libavcodec has a callback which is called as soon as 
one slice of the picture has been decoded, so that the copying can be 
done while that slice is still in the cache.
I'm currently thinking of using that feature in the softdevice, but it 
would be nice to have some hard numbers on the improvement especially 
for processors with small caches to decide how important that feature is.
In fact it is not that difficult to implement, but it would take some 
time to do it right ;-)
