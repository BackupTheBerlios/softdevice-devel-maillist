</I>&gt;<i> &gt; past with a similar setup!). I haven't tested this in a forwards
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; direction but think it will probably be the same. Am I missing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something obvious here or are other people seeing this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a similar setup (g450) and can confirm this problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Looking at the HISTORY file for vdr, vdr-1.5.15 has: &quot;Improved
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sending all frames to devices that can handle them in fast forward
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trick speeds, including subtitles&quot;. This is through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the virtual function bool cDevice::HasIBPTrickSpeed(void) { return
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; false; } which doesn't seem to be implemented by softdevice and so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the return value should be false.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What I'm seeing is almost as if softdevice is only expecting I-frames
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; during trickspeed but vdr is sending it all frames and so when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; playback returns to normal speed, it is many frames away from where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it should be.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another thing I've noticed is that if I press &quot;0&quot; during replay to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; add a cut-mark, it adds it about a second or so after when I pressed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it. I know it will put the cut mark at the nearest I-frame but this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is a much larger jump.
</I>
A little bit more information after a few more tests:

I have keys '1' and '3' set in cReplayControl::ProcessKey in menu.c as 
follows:

    case k1|k_Repeat:
    case k1:       SkipSeconds(-10); break;
    case k3|k_Repeat:
    case k3:       SkipSeconds( 10); break;

I.e. skip 10 s backwards or forwards. I'm pretty sure that these used to 
give jumps which were pretty close to 10 s in each direction. I now get 7 
s backwards and 14 s forwards instead of 10 s!

Jumping a minute forward or backwards gave me something like 53 s 
backwards and 1 min 14 s forwards! Not sure how close they used to be to 
a minute, though.

If I pause and then press a forward or backwards key for slow motion, 
forwards works as expected. Backwards runs back rapidly for about a 
minute (of time in the recording) in about a second, then slows for a 
further 10 s or so (of recording time) and then finally starts stepping 
slowly backwards!

Cheers,

Laz
