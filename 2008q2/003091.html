<PRE>
I've just built a new vdr box with vdr-1.7.0 (with liemikuutio path but 
I'm pretty sure this stuff isn't touched), softdevice cvs from a few days 
back, ffmpeg svn from a few days back (SVN-r12942 it claims), 
DirectFB-1.1.1, a Matrox G450 for output.

All works fine apart from when I try to scan a few seconds backwards 
through a recording with trickspeed 2x. When I begin replay, it has gone 
back much further than it should have (and has done so in the past with a 
similar setup!). I haven't tested this in a forwards direction but think 
it will probably be the same. Am I missing something obvious here or are 
other people seeing this?

Looking at the HISTORY file for vdr, vdr-1.5.15 has: &quot;Improved sending all 
frames to devices that can handle them in fast forward trick speeds, 
including subtitles&quot;. This is through 
the virtual function bool cDevice::HasIBPTrickSpeed(void) { return 
false; } which doesn't seem to be implemented by softdevice and so the 
return value should be false.

What I'm seeing is almost as if softdevice is only expecting I-frames 
during trickspeed but vdr is sending it all frames and so when playback 
returns to normal speed, it is many frames away from where it should be.

Another thing I've noticed is that if I press &quot;0&quot; during replay to add a 
cut-mark, it adds it about a second or so after when I pressed it. I know 
it will put the cut mark at the nearest I-frame but this is a much larger 
jump.

Any thoughts on where to look for clues on this?

Cheers,

Laz
