Sorry: the web server was down. Back up now. However, I think Rolf 
Ahrenberg posted a link to an updated version. (I haven't had a chance to 
get back to it yet!)

&gt;<i> From my memory I can say that I was surprised that the patch was so

</I>
It seems quite stable on the short tests I've tried such as leaving it 
going all day whilst I'm at work or overnight. The main problem is the 
scaling and aspect ratio. I'm just Blitting straight to the video surface 
at the moment!

&gt;<i> I also remember that you 
</I>&gt;<i> used the SetupStore for some global variables which weren't really
</I>&gt;<i> setup options. Please don't do that, especially the index of the next
</I>&gt;<i> picture doesn't belong there.
</I>
Sorry about that: I knew it was quite nasty! It was a quick bodge to see 
if it actually worked. I'm still finding my feet a bit with C++ and I 
couldn't easily see anywhere else which could be accessed by both 
cMpeg2Decoder and cDFBVideoOut!

I think Rolf has tidied it up a bit but I haven't had a chance to look 
yet: he may have sorted out the variables.

Cheers,

Laz
