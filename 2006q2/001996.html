Yes: took me a while to work out what was wrong. It's quite difficult to spot 
transparent text in an opaque background!

;)

I had a quick go at trying SetLevel(-1) after reading Readme.txt in the 
DirectFB unichrome driver source. I can't actually remember what that did but 
I lost either the OSD or the video layer completely!

Just tested again: commenting out the SetLevel(1) made no difference; setting 
it to -1 gives me no visible video, even when the OSD is absent. I also don't 
see any glimpses of video through any of the text with it like this. I also 
tried setting osdDsc.pixelformat = DSPF_AiRGB (see below) to no effect, i.e. 
with SetLevel(-1) I still saw no video layer.

Maybe this is a change in DirectFB so that the alpha channel isn't reversed 
(assuming that's how it was before!). Just had a quick go setting 
AlphaInversed to false and it didn't seem to have any effect at all.

Maybe this is something deeper in SoftOsd.c? Not really delved into that 
yet...

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think that the depth of the alpha channel isn't quite as good as it

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; before they were transparent and nicely alpha blended).

Sounds familiar. To quote bits from the DirectFB unichrome Readme.txt file:

Special features
----------------

* The video overlay layer can be placed beneath the primary layer,
  which can have an alpha channel.

  To enable this, set the level of the overlay to -1 (using SetLevel)
  and enable the DLOP_ALPHACHANNEL option on the primary.  Then use
  either ARGB or AiRGB as the primary pixel format (see also 'known
  bugs and quirks' below).

Known bugs and quirks
---------------------

* In underlay mode (see 'special features', above), the video
  is fully visible where the primary layer's alpha is 255, and
  invisible (= graphics visible) where the alpha is 0.

  There are two options to overcome this:

  The first is to use the special pixel format AiRGB.

  The second is to XOR the alpha channel of the surface, e.g. just
  before flipping the primary surface.


Now this &quot;Special feature&quot; sounds like the behaviour we would want here but 
the video layer is currently set to layer 1 rather than -1 (and see above!):

if (isVIAUnichrome)
            videoLayer-&gt;SetLevel(1);

DLOP_ALPHACHANNEL is being enabled just above here, too. The pixel format is 
DSPF_ARGB, as far as I can tell.

More details:

I generally use skinsoppalusikka and this appears as everything fully opaque 
except black text (or anything else?) being fully transparent. Switching to 
the standard vdr skin or the ST-TNG skin gives me a fully transparent 
background with coloured opaque text, except for the selected line of a menu 
or menu titles which have fully transparent text.

Cheers,

Laz
