<PRE>Hi list,
Hi Tobi,

first of all a big thank you to the softdevice-team for providing 
softdevice and softplay. I'm using it now since one year and after some 
starting difficulties and after switching to e-tobi.net (for using vdr 
without headaches) I have to say this solution is very stable. Is it time 
for softdevice 1.0?

When Tobi included softplay as a package I considered to use it to watch 
xvids (instead of manual invoking mplayer on my vdr-machine). And another 
time I was convinced that softdevice/softplay is a stable solution. 
Setting up a vdr with softdevice/play is easier than using vdr with a 
ff-card and the mplayer-plugin.

Unfortunately softplay seems not to be so popular and I think that is why 
the softplay-plugin is not up-to-date in his repository. It currently 
needs vdr-1.3.41 . I was staying at that version as long as I could resist 
to update, but now there is vdr 1.4 and I really wanted to update.

So I updated normally apt-get update ... bla. Except softplay everything 
is working very fine.

This morning I simply thought, just getting the vdr-plugin-softplay 
package source, getting the -dev-dependencies and a simply 
dpkg-buildpackage is enough to create a softplay-package for vdr-1.4 . I 
was not completely wrong:

The softplay menu entry appears, I can select all my media files but one 
thing is strange:

When I play a file (which was working yesterday with 1.3.41 and softplay) 
I just get audio now and &quot;colored snow&quot; as a picture. I have absolutely no 
idea what is wrong. My feeling is, that the video cannot be decoded by 
libavcodec. When updating Debian not only e-tobi was updated, but also 
other packages from testing. I also used the latest CVS source of softplay 
- result is the same.

I tried it on my vdr-machine (using dfb with mga) and on my 
desktop-machine using xv - both have the same symptoms.

During the compilation I saw some warnings (attached is the build-output).

I have the feeling there is a lot I could do to track down the problem, 
but to be honest, I don't exactly know where to start. I would appreciate 
if someone can help me debugging this issue and I'll be happy to provide 
useful information.

best regards,
Patrick.
