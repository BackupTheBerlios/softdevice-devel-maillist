I agree with you that it would be the best to share as much code as
possible. I had a look at the latest libviaXvMC and in fact
viaLowLevel.c is very similar to what Laz uses in his library. The one
major difference is the use of DMA, and I don't know if it is simple to
set up DMA from userspace. So maybe it is the best to start with the
code as it is now and try to get it working and then try to synchronize
the code bases.

What I'm not really sure about is what are Laz's plans for the library.
Laz, do you want your library to a stand alone library or would you like
to try to integrate it into DirectFB?  I would prefer the latter - but I
guess that means more work...

&gt;<i> To clear up a couple of questions that were raised:-
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The original ddmpeg library worked under both X and FB. However it is a 
</I>&gt;<i> proprietary VIA specific interface and only taken advantage of with VeMP and 
</I>&gt;<i> VeXP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The most pressing question on my mind is: is it possible to reduce the
CPU load by getting rid of the busy loop while waiting for the decoder
to become ready again? It's quite stupid to waste CPU time just for
waiting for the decoder if the goal of using the decoder was to save CPU
time :-)

It is really good to know that you are interested in the development, so
we can ask a lot of questions concerning the via chipset :-)

Bye,
Martin
