Still a bit early for that, I'm afraid!

&gt;<i> If you modified libsoftmpeg, you can also upload your mods to the

That would be good. As it stands, libsoftmpeg does both the decoding and 
displaying of an MPEG stream as separate threads (still not worked out 
whether it will do MPEG1 as well as MPEG2...). The decoded frames end up 
in DirectFB surfaces which are then flipped. I'm sure it would be much 
simpler if I removed the display thread (or made it optional) and let 
something else do the actual flipping step.

I may also remove all traces of avcodec from my version so that it would 
then only work with CLE266 (and CLE400?) chips. At the moment, there are 
huge chunks of code which are ignored due to #defines.

&gt;<i> &gt; I'll need to do a bit more testing with this and then I'll try to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work it into an output method for softdevice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Great !
</I>&gt;<i> I just though about something : if your code is a new output method, it

</I>&gt;<i> et al. Maybe it's better implemented as an alternate decoder for the
</I>&gt;<i> directfb output method, giving a chance to still use current libavcodec
</I>&gt;<i> for other codecs.
</I>
I thought softplay was pretty much stand-alone and used ffmpeg to decode 
stuff: softdevice also uses ffmpeg but only decodes MPEG streams.

&gt;<i> &gt; I doubt I'll get much done before the weekend, though...
</I>&gt;<i>

Cheers,
