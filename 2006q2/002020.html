</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I agree with you that mpeg2decoder contains things which doesn't belong
there, for example the filtering together with the filter contexts.

&gt;<i> I guess at the current state, the whole cle266 code is a hack. But if I would get

</I>&gt;<i> that, even in some hackish state, into our cvs. Let's polish code later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Here I don't understand you, on one hand you say mpeg2decoder should not
grow anymore, on the other hand you want to include a hack into
mpeg2decoder, which will certainly not make the code more readable. And
who is going to do the clean up? I don't think that we will receive
patches by other people which clean the mess up once the code is in. So
it is either you or me who has to do the cleaning. Will you do this?

Right now there seem several people interested in getting the cle266
decoder work with the softdevice, you and me included. So in my opinion
it is the best to do it right from the start, and not to include hacks.
 To me that means that we should process all the information of the
stream inside the decoders (inside mpeg2decoder) and pass only the
relevant information (dimension, aspect ratio, the pictures,...) to the
filters and the video out.

&gt;<i> The only thing which must (should) be changed, is the layer index carried
</I>&gt;<i> in setup store. This should be a public member in videoDecoder. Unused
</I>&gt;<i> by others, so it doesn't harm.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>It doesn't have to be a public member in videoDecoder, it can also be a
local variable in cVideoStreamDecoder::DecodePacker(), but the important
point is how we pass it to the video-out. I think we need a structure
here which can pass the pictures to the video out, which supports direct
rendering.

&gt;&gt;<i> The state of AVFrame and codec are undefined as long as we don't use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> libavcodec (of course we allocate it, but usually we don't fill it), so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think it's dangerous to pretend that everything is ok. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Filling only those members which are sufficiant to make CheckAspect..
</I>&gt;<i> and co. work, should be ok (setting only direct members, not those 
</I>&gt;<i> accessed via pointers). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>As you say it _should_ be ok, but _will_ it be ok? What will happen when
we include the next hack? What will break? What happens if ffmpeg
changes in some subtle way? No, I don't like this, it is a hack and
nothing else.


Bye,
Martin
