Summary: MMX2 detected on VIA C3, does not exist

Details: On VIA C3 CPUs configure detects the chip as having MMX2. This is not the case, it has Cyrix extended MMX, which is a bit different. I don't remember all the gory details, but here's at least some discussion about the issue: 
<A HREF="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.ffmpeg.devel/31865">http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.ffmpeg.devel/31865</A>

Quick solution is to change config.h and Makefile (i.e. turn off MMX2), maybe a patch could be made so that all MMX2 stuff would not have to be disabled, as it is partially supported. Affected functions are at least fast_memcpy in utils.c and ScaleUpHoriz_MMX in SoftOsd.c around line 1516. The first asm part seems to work.

Comment:
Hm, the configure script doesn't autodetect mmx or mmx2, by default it is on, I added now a switch which makes it possible to disable it.

About the MMX2, this should in fact only be the subset of instructions which is present in SSE, 3Dnow and MMX2, since the early VIA CPUs support 3Dnow I assumed that it should work for them as well.
I'm sorry the link you posted doesn't reveal much details about which instructions are supported and which aren't, so currently I can't do much about the insctructions.  If you can tell me more details (or just send a patch which disables everything which doesn't work with a preprocessor switch) I will have a look at it again.
For now I can just advice you to switch of MMX2, as you already did.

Bye,
Martin
