<PRE>I know this has been mentioned several times in the past but I don't think 
anyone has made any progress in getting hardware MPEG decoding on the Via 
CLE266 and related chips from DirectFB apps. I have a Via Epia system running 
vdr with softdevice using DirectFB TV-out output, and this works really well 
but it is just on the limit of what the CPU can do when it is decoding the 
MPEG2 stream in software, so I get a few jerks and A-V sync isn't as good as 
it should be. I've started looking into this again now...

Currently, softdevice uses libavcodec to do the actual MPEG2 decoding. What I 
was hoping for was a simple slot-in solution where I just pass the relevant 
MPEG2 data to a different library, retrieve the decoded frames, and leave 
softdevice to display them using DirectFB.

Here is a summary of what I've found and my understanding:

libddmpeg: the original one from Via and the one reverse engineered by Ivor 
Hewitt. I believe that both of these rely on X and so aren't as helpful as 
I'd like them to be for this instance.

VeXP-VIAXine: not really delved into this but I think this requires X too.

cle266mp-plugin: This is an output plugin for mplayer. Still in the process of 
studying this. Not sure whether it requires X or not, i.e. whether this 
plugin displays the video as well as decoding it.

mtest: not fully built this yet because it requires a patch to DirectFB. It 
seems to need /dev/cle266vgaio which linux-viafb from DirectFB doesn't 
provide. (Seen mention of using the cle266vgaio module at the same time as 
the viafb module: not looked into this yet.) This one only depends on 
DirectFB but only decodes video and not audio.

All of the above (except mtest) are tied into X so mtest is probably the 
easiest starting point. Nothing that I've found does _just_ decoding: they 
all decode and display the images.
