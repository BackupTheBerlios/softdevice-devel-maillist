</I>I had a look at the latest libViaXvMC and it seems that they do sleep in
the loop using nanosleep. I'm not sure if nanosleep has a better
resolution, they also seem to use DMA to copy the slices, maybe that
makes a difference. I think I remember much lower CPU usages (less &lt;10%)
from xine using the latest X11 XvMC VIA hw decoding, does somebody know
some numbers? Is it worth to think about integrating the DMA routines?


&gt;<i> Do we need to determine coded_picture_number somehow, too? This is probably 
</I>&gt;<i> why I'm getting the odd # in my output:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>No, that is not needed, it is a part of a hack which we use to sort the
pts values to the decoded frames. With my pts patch to your library we
already know the pts values.

In fact quite a lot of the code inside
cVideoStreamDecoder::DecodePacket() which deals with pts values is not
needed in your case. One could try to gather the ffmpeg specific stuff
and move it into a separate method, which returns a more general picture
structure already including the pts. For the via hw decoding one could
write a similar method... I will send my patch for direct rendering to
the list, it is still unfinished and may crash, but it is probably good
to discuss if it is useful for your patches and what changes still need
to be done.

Bye,
Martin
