</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I have to admit that the progress is currently slow, I don't have that
much time to spent on the softdevice and there are many things to be
done... What I plan is to integrate the Via Xvmc acceleration into the
softdevice. Unfortunately the current design of the video out doesn't
allow this (direct rendering is needed, different image formats...), so
I have to change quite fundamental things in the softdevice. Since I
want not to mess up the softdevice code I have to do that in small pieces...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the information is there it just needs someone to pull it all 
</I>&gt;<i> together!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Did I understand correctly, that you will try to do this? That would be
great!


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Has anyone made any more progress with this or am I starting from
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> scratch? Ultimately, the best route would probably be to incorporate
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hardware decoding into ffmpeg or similar but, for now, I'd just be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> happy to get it working from softdevice!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are mainly two possible routes : the great and beautiful one,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where you integrate all needed functionnaly inside one of ffmpeg,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> libavcodec, or similar library, remove X dependencies, etc. And the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fast and hackish one, where you get small library parts, pack them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> together and have a working, albeit uncomplete thingy. That's how the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> viafb kernel module evolved... Once basic support is available, will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> come the time to write beautiful code...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed. It seems that most of the effort ended up going into the 
</I>&gt;<i> unichrome / openchrome projects rather than creating a nice, 
</I>&gt;<i> self-contained library!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I think I remember that the openchrome developers once search for
someone who would integrate the mpeg2 hardware acceleration into
DirectFB, but obviously the didn't find anyone...

What I can say is that the patch to ffmpeg to use the VLD-Xvmc is rather
small (it can be extracted from the mplayer patch on openchrome), so
getting support form ffmpeg should not be difficult.
Please keep us updated on your progress!

Bye,
Martin
