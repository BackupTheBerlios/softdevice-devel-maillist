It seems to be something which gets mentioned every now and then  but 
nothing ever seems to come of it!

&gt;<i> &gt; mtest: not fully built this yet because it requires a patch to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DirectFB. It seems to need /dev/cle266vgaio which linux-viafb from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DirectFB doesn't provide. (Seen mention of using the cle266vgaio
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; module at the same time as the viafb module: not looked into this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yet.) This one only depends on DirectFB but only decodes video and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not audio.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> cle266vgaio is an old kernel modules which should provide sufficient
</I>&gt;<i> interface to the CLE266, when using the VESA frame-buffer kernel module
</I>&gt;<i> with DirectFB. It should be replaced by the newer viafb from the
</I>&gt;<i> DirectFB CVS (which comes from... see HISTORY file).
</I>
Yes. Emails from Mark Adams suggests that I can mmap /dev/fb0 from viafb 
in the way it would have been done with /dev/cle266vgaio. I have built 
mtest so that it uses /dev/fb0 rather than /dev/cle266vgaio but haven't 
managed to get it to work yet: it sits in a loop, waiting for the decoder 
to become ready. I need to convince myself that it is checking the 
correct register for this!

&gt;<i> I just searched through my old code and tests and found the libsoftmpeg
</I>&gt;<i> library, which came (early 2004) with a VDR plugin, in order to provide
</I>&gt;<i> something like softdevice does. This library was once patched to allow
</I>&gt;<i> hardware MPEG decoding. I still have the whole code there, and found a
</I>&gt;<i> reference to &quot;mtest&quot;, without any &quot;mtest.*&quot; file.

That would certainly be helpful: please send it to this email address. I 
am currently pooling together as much code as I can which may be 
relevant. I'm starting to see some similarities between it, too!

;)

I think the information is there it just needs someone to pull it all 
together!

&gt;<i> &gt; All of the above (except mtest) are tied into X so mtest is probably
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the easiest starting point. Nothing that I've found does _just_
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decoding: they all decode and display the images.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just saw a reference inside a file above :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * This code has no video output dependencies. The user code must
</I>&gt;<i>  * set up a framebuffer for video display, and 4x YUV420 format
</I>&gt;<i>  * buffers within video memory.
</I>&gt;<i>  *
</I>&gt;<i>  * A user code must implement the 'blah' function which
</I>&gt;<i>  * is called whenever the picture size changes after a
</I>&gt;<i>  * sequence header. This should rescale the video output
</I>&gt;<i>  * as appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ie. : the decoder outputs the decoded chunks in video memory, but you
</I>&gt;<i> still have a chance to get them back (rescale, convert, grab, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> That's what Xine must do to run it's post-process plug-ins).
</I>
That would be the best bet for a stand-alone library, i.e. send the 
decoder data and read the decoded frames back out again, rather than 
flipping the buffer directly. I was hoping to just replace the call to 
avcodec_decode_video() in softdevice, rather than having to mess about 
with the DirectFB code for adding as OSD layer, etc.!

&gt;<i> &gt; Has anyone made any more progress with this or am I starting from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scratch? Ultimately, the best route would probably be to incorporate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hardware decoding into ffmpeg or similar but, for now, I'd just be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; happy to get it working from softdevice!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are mainly two possible routes : the great and beautiful one,
</I>&gt;<i> where you integrate all needed functionnaly inside one of ffmpeg,
</I>&gt;<i> libavcodec, or similar library, remove X dependencies, etc. And the
</I>&gt;<i> fast and hackish one, where you get small library parts, pack them
</I>&gt;<i> together and have a working, albeit uncomplete thingy. That's how the
</I>&gt;<i> viafb kernel module evolved... Once basic support is available, will
</I>&gt;<i> come the time to write beautiful code...
</I>
Indeed. It seems that most of the effort ended up going into the 
unichrome / openchrome projects rather than creating a nice, 
self-contained library!

Cheers,

Laz
