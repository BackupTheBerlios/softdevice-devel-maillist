The remote works with softdevice CVS as of now and vdr 1.3.49.  Last time
I tested, the CVS repository probably was in an inconsistent state.
(Any plans of switching to Subversion or some other revision control system
where commits are atomic?)

In fact, I had to revert to using the softdevice-dfb remote, because
vdr-remote-0.3.6 maps key-repeat events to key-press.  I didn't notice,
because I usually press the buttons for less than 0.1 seconds, but my
family had trouble with it.  As the logic in vdr-remote looked complex,
I didn't try to fix it.

The only issue I have with the softdevice-dfb remote is that DirectFB
performs a many-to-one mapping of keycodes, making the &quot;&gt;|&quot; and &quot;|&lt;&quot;
buttons on the new Hauppauge remote inaccessible.  I wonder if it would
make sense to implement a direct &lt;linux/input.h&gt; interface to video.c.
All RCUs bundled with DVB tuner cards are using that interface, right?
