Ups, top left corner ...

Can you try this after line 355 in video-dfb.c:

  if (desc.caps &amp; DLCAPS_SCREEN_LOCATION)
  {
    try 
    {
       videoLayer-&gt;SetScreenLocation(0.0,0.0,0.5,0.5);
       videoLayer-&gt;SetScreenLocation(0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0);
    }
    catch (DFBException *ex)
    {
      fprintf (stderr, &quot;[dfb] SetParams: action=%s, result=%s\n&quot;, ex-&gt;GetAction(), ex-&gt;GetResult());
      delete ex;
    }
  }

Perhaps SetParams() gets not called due to missing information
size/aspect ratio of decoded frames.
