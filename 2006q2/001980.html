I tried the patches last night.  The kernel patch was fine: I only had
to resolve one trivial conflict (changed context, I guess).  I'm using
kernel 2.6.16.14.  Then I updated DirectFB to CVS, but I gave up trying
to resolve the conflicts.

This sounds very promising.  Could you post the adapted DirectFB patch, so
that I can try it out?  Currently, -vo dfb:mgatv drops frames every now
and then on my 900 MHz Celeron box.
