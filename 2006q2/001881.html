<PRE>Laz a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> I know this has been mentioned several times in the past but I don't think 
</I>&gt;<i> anyone has made any progress in getting hardware MPEG decoding on the Via 
</I>&gt;<i> CLE266 and related chips from DirectFB apps. I have a Via Epia system running 
</I>&gt;<i> vdr with softdevice using DirectFB TV-out output, and this works really well 
</I>&gt;<i> but it is just on the limit of what the CPU can do when it is decoding the 
</I>&gt;<i> MPEG2 stream in software, so I get a few jerks and A-V sync isn't as good as 
</I>&gt;<i> it should be. I've started looking into this again now...
</I>
It's really nice to see that there is still interest in this solution !
Since I still didn't upgrade from vdr 1.3.33 / softdevice 0.2.0, I can't
help very much with this, but I can still recall ancient threads, test,
etc...

...
&gt;<i> mtest: not fully built this yet because it requires a patch to DirectFB. It 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to need /dev/cle266vgaio which linux-viafb from DirectFB doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> provide. (Seen mention of using the cle266vgaio module at the same time as 
</I>&gt;<i> the viafb module: not looked into this yet.) This one only depends on 
</I>&gt;<i> DirectFB but only decodes video and not audio.
</I>
cle266vgaio is an old kernel modules which should provide sufficient
interface to the CLE266, when using the VESA frame-buffer kernel module
with DirectFB. It should be replaced by the newer viafb from the
DirectFB CVS (which comes from... see HISTORY file).
I just searched through my old code and tests and found the libsoftmpeg
library, which came (early 2004) with a VDR plugin, in order to provide
something like softdevice does. This library was once patched to allow
hardware MPEG decoding. I still have the whole code there, and found a
reference to &quot;mtest&quot;, without any &quot;mtest.*&quot; file.
Maybe I have there a useful library that you could work from ? I think
the core is in the following directory :

  2467 Feb  6  2004 libcle266mpeg/GetFBOffset.patch
  1658 Feb  6  2004 libcle266mpeg/GetFBOffsetDFB++.patch
  1108 Feb  6  2004 libcle266mpeg/README.txt
  5567 Mar 23  2004 libcle266mpeg/cle266mpegdec.c
  1786 Mar 20  2004 libcle266mpeg/cle266mpegdec.h
  5610 Mar 21  2004 libcle266mpeg/debug.c
   574 Feb  6  2004 libcle266mpeg/debug.h
  7736 Mar 21  2004 libcle266mpeg/decoder.c
  4619 Feb  6  2004 libcle266mpeg/decoder.h
  4109 Mar 27  2004 libcle266mpeg/hwdec.c
   874 Feb  6  2004 libcle266mpeg/hwdec.h
 10017 Feb  6  2004 libcle266mpeg/mpeg2defs.h
 10476 Feb  6  2004 libcle266mpeg/parser.c
  3556 Feb  6  2004 libcle266mpeg/parser.h
 16700 Feb  6  2004 libcle266mpeg/scanner.c
  5640 Feb  6  2004 libcle266mpeg/scanner.h

I can send you the whole stuff via PM, if needed.

&gt;<i> All of the above (except mtest) are tied into X so mtest is probably the 
</I>&gt;<i> easiest starting point. Nothing that I've found does _just_ decoding: they 
</I>&gt;<i> all decode and display the images.
</I>
Just saw a reference inside a file above :

 * This code has no video output dependencies. The user code must
 * set up a framebuffer for video display, and 4x YUV420 format
 * buffers within video memory.
 *
 * A user code must implement the 'blah' function which
 * is called whenever the picture size changes after a
 * sequence header. This should rescale the video output
 * as appropriate.

ie. : the decoder outputs the decoded chunks in video memory, but you
still have a chance to get them back (rescale, convert, grab, etc.
That's what Xine must do to run it's post-process plug-ins).

...
&gt;<i> Has anyone made any more progress with this or am I starting from scratch? 
</I>&gt;<i> Ultimately, the best route would probably be to incorporate hardware decoding 
</I>&gt;<i> into ffmpeg or similar but, for now, I'd just be happy to get it working from 
</I>&gt;<i> softdevice!
</I>
There are mainly two possible routes : the great and beautiful one,
where you integrate all needed functionnaly inside one of ffmpeg,
libavcodec, or similar library, remove X dependencies, etc. And the fast
and hackish one, where you get small library parts, pack them together
and have a working, albeit uncomplete thingy. That's how the viafb
kernel module evolved... Once basic support is available, will come the
time to write beautiful code...
