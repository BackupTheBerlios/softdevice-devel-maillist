I'm not convinced that your numbers here are correct: I get black borders at 
the top and bottom of my 16:9 TV now. I also found a channel which wasn't 
expanded properly horizontally. I'll see if I can find the relevant bits in 
ffmpeg and see what values are set there. I was seeing things like 64/45 when 
I looked at the output from software decoding.

&gt;<i> &gt; I did try the usleep hack in the decoder. It really brings my CPU load

Your patch and library seem to work fine for me apart from the black borders.

&gt;<i> I haven't had the time yet to look at your latest code, hopefully I will

</I>&gt;<i> But I want to say that the usleep part isn't properly working also for

</I>&gt;<i> but I fear that usleep won't work. The minimum sleep time is 1ms
</I>&gt;<i> (depending on the kernel) and that seems to be too much.
</I>
I must admit that I thought the resolution would be better than that! Maybe 
having it without is the best that can be achieved practically.

Do we need to determine coded_picture_number somehow, too? This is probably 
why I'm getting the odd # in my output:

    /* ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * DV read via dv1394 seems to have
     * context-&gt;coded_frame-&gt;coded_picture_number
     * always set to zero. Therefor lets do the following guess upon current
     * PTS value. Don't know if there are other codecs which deliver
     * codec_picture_number as zero.
     * Hopefully noone else will see '#' chars printed.
     */
    if (!pts &amp;&amp; lastPTS != (int64_t) AV_NOPTS_VALUE)
    {
       fprintf(stderr,&quot;#&quot;);
       pts = lastPTS;
    }

Cheers,

Laz
