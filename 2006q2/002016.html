<PRE>I've made a bit of progress with my patch for CLE266 hardware MPEG2 decoding. 
Current version should be available here:

<A HREF="http://vdr.club-burniston.co.uk/softdevice_cle266.diff">http://vdr.club-burniston.co.uk/softdevice_cle266.diff</A>

This is based on softdevice cvs from today and includes Rolf's autoconf bits 
so that the configure script will include support automatically, if it finds 
the decoding library.

This version needs to be built against Rolf Ahrenberg's tarball of the decoder 
library (not the original one I did)
<A HREF="http://www.saunalahti.fi/~rahrenbe/vdr/patches/libcle266mpegdec-0.1.tar.gz">http://www.saunalahti.fi/~rahrenbe/vdr/patches/libcle266mpegdec-0.1.tar.gz</A>

and it should also be patched to add support for storing PTS values:
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/softdevice-devel/2006q2/001987.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/softdevice-devel/2006q2/001987.html</A>

I've put in a few more sanity checks and moved a variable I had added to 
cSetupSoftdevice into cVideoOut.

It is now 'sort of' full screen: the scaling of the video layer comes from 
context-&gt;sample_aspect_ratio.num and context-&gt;sample_aspect_ratio.den which 
would be set by avcodec_decode_video() (unless I've missed something!). At 
the moment, I am forcing these to 64 and 45, respectively, which are the 
values I was seeing for a 720x576 stream at 16:9. This means that a stream of 
this resolution is correct but resolutions such as 704x576 aren't expanded 
and have black borders at the sides.

Switching channels or jumping within a recording has a delay of about a second 
or so whilst the decoder sorts itself out (it probably needs resetting in 
these situations, or something: not really explored this yet) but seems to 
work OK otherwise.

Not tested it for any length of time, yet, so I'm not sure of the long-term 
stability yet. There is a little bit of stuttering with interlaced streams: 
not sure of the source of this yet, and the A-V sync needs sorting out. I 
need to get my head around how the PTS values are used in the sync algorithm: 
some parts seem to come from the call to avcodec_decode_video() and others 
from libavformat.

I've also found that adding a usleep(100) at ca. line 110 of 
libcle266mpegdec/src/decoder.c decreases the CPU usage a lot: the overall CPU 
usage drops from ca. 80% with software decoding, to ca. 35% with hardware 
decoding without the usleep, and to ca. 14% with it. The highest load process 
is now down to 9% or so. In theory, there is an interrupt for when the 
decoder is ready but apparently the hardware is broken.

Still needs working on but it's getting there and looking good!
