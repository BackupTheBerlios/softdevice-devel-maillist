Tried this but missed to read this message about removing the
conditional between lines 993 and 998, and now it's sooo late, wil have
to try tomorrow. But, I can tell you what I could see this way:
- video on my G400 TVout is very smooth;
- OSD has double height (only see upper half over whole screen area);
- during and once more 2 or 3 seconds after channel change, and on
showing/hiding the OSD as well, there is a very visible flicker in which
one can always see what looks like one field of the video displayed only
in the upper half of the screen (288 lines, squashed).
What impact should have had removing that conditional, any change on
what I described? I noticed that your configure script didn't detect
HAVE_DSBLIT_INTERLACED, although I checked out DirectFB this evening,
like softdevice. I grepped after DSBLIT_INTERLACED in the whole DirectFB
source, didn't find it. I must be missing something, going to bed now...
