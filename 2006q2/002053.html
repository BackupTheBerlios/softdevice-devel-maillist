Quoting from libxvmc/viaLowlevel.c from the openchrome driver:

static void
syncMpeg(XvMCLowLevel * xl, unsigned int mode, unsigned int doSleep)
{
    /*
     * Ideally, we'd like to have an interrupt wait here, but from 
information from VIA
     * at least the MPEG completion interrupt is broken on the CLE266, 
which was
     * discovered during validation of the chip.
     */

However, there is the inclusion of a nanosleep for 1 ns, although I think 
you need to be running as root or with realtime priority for this to 
work, otherwise the sleep is a few ms, I think. In fact, from: 
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/IO-Port-Programming-4.html">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/IO-Port-Programming-4.html</A>

&quot;nanosleep()
In the 2.0.x series of Linux kernels, there is a new system call, 
nanosleep() (see the nanosleep(2) manual page), that allows you to sleep 
or delay for short times (a few microseconds or more).

For delays &lt;= 2 ms, if (and only if) your process is set to soft real time 
scheduling (using sched_setscheduler()), nanosleep() uses a busy loop; 
otherwise it sleeps, just like usleep().

The busy loop uses udelay() (an internal kernel function used by many 
kernel drivers), and the length of the loop is calculated using the 
BogoMips value (the speed of this kind of busy loop is one of the things 
that BogoMips measures accurately). See /usr/include/asm/delay.h) for 
details on how it works.&quot;

Just done a quick test with nanosleep() and get about 1-2 ms delay without 
changing the priority.

Cheers,

Laz
