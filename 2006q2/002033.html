<PRE>Hi list,

I'm sending you my first concept for direct rendering with the
softdevice, meaning that the video-out allocates the picture buffes (not
necessarily in video memory, which may be slower). There are many
advantages of direct rendering, for example the pictures get allocated
by the video out, so they can be used at any time by the video out,
without having to fear that they have been deleted (because the
mpeg2decoder has been reseted). Very nice for software alpha blending
and we can also implement screenshots a lot easier :-). X11 XvMC needs
direct rendering and I think Laz patches also could benefit from it. For
Xv-out it would also be faster to use direct rendering.

The main part is the PicBuffer structure:

  typedef struct sPicBuffer {
    PixelFormat format;
    uint8_t *pixel[4];
    int stride[4];
    unsigned int use_count;
    int max_width;
    int max_height;
    int edge_width;  // needed by ffmpeg
    int edge_height; // needed by ffmpeg
    int Width;
    int Height;
    int buf_num;      // video-out specific buffer number
    int pic_num;     // needed by ffmpeg
    void *priv_data;
  };

I want to propose to use this structure (which can of course be extended
 by aspect ratio,pts etc..) for decoded pictures.
If one uses filters, the decoder should allocate the picture buffers
from the filters, the filters from the video out, else the decoder
should directly use the buffers from the video out.
My patch already overrides ffmpegs get_buffer()/release_buffer() to use
picture buffes from the video out, the filters still have to be changed.

In case of Laz hardware decoding patches the fb could be stored in
buf_num, and if one sets up *pixel[] correctly even filtering would be
possible (but most likely it would be slow...), however it would be nice
for software alpha blending.

There are still a lot of open questions, especially on the filtering...
Comments are welcome :-)

Bye,
Martin
