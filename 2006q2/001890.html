I think your are referring to this thread on directfb-users:
<A HREF="http://mail.directfb.org/pipermail/directfb-users/2005-October/000770.html">http://mail.directfb.org/pipermail/directfb-users/2005-October/000770.html</A>

But before pushing that again on directfb lists, I have to test Ville's
modifications he suggested in this thread (long time ago too):

Or has anyone tried his patches from?
<A HREF="http://mail.directfb.org/pipermail/directfb-dev/2005-October/000846.html">http://mail.directfb.org/pipermail/directfb-dev/2005-October/000846.html</A>

There was low feedback on directfb-dev.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This bug *severely* affects the effectiveness of softdevice for me.  I
</I>&gt;<i> have a 4:3 TV.  This bug means:
</I>&gt;<i>       * I have to view all my channels as centre cut instead of
</I>&gt;<i>         letterboxed.  I would prefer not to loose the sides of every

</I>
&gt;<i>       * softplay's output is 'broken' (because hardly any material is at
</I>&gt;<i>         a resolution the same as softdevices output)
</I>
That's the part I do not understand even though softplay is 
Martin's baby. 

&gt;<i>       * ntsc material is 'broken' (I know there are framerate problems
</I>&gt;<i>         as well, but I can put up with the bad frame rate, but not the
</I>&gt;<i>         wobbly pictures)
</I>
I guess you want PAL/NTSC recognition on the fly. This should be
possible, even if we have to reinitialise directfb complete.

(@Martin: In that case I need the videoInitialized variable allways,
as state changes like: videoInitialized -&gt; !videoInitialized -&gt; videoInitialized)

The only drawback is that directfb only can PAL and NTSC. PAL60 is to my 
knowledge not possible. The difference is composite out. In NTSC mode
you need a real NTSC device. Usually PAL TVs can do some sort
of 60Hz mode (timing from NTSC, but color info on composite encoded
as PAL).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, this bug means that MGA TV-Out softdevice is very limited.
</I>
Can agree to that. A few months ago when I recognized that issue,
it was a nogo argument for me too [ switching my main TV to 
softdevice :-( ]. It caused some frustration on me (ac3 solved but ..) .


The most annoying thing and most difficult to resolve is to my opinion:
16:9 downscaled on 4:3 TV.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I may get a chance to look at the code sometime, but I wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> know if anyone is working on it at the moment.  (I have had a quick look
</I>&gt;<i> and so far it is not obvious how the code works...)
