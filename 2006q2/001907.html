</I>
That's about it: I have had hardware decoding going with xine and XVMC but 
I don't really want the additional overhead of running X on my vdr box!

</I>&gt;<i> From my latest private mail exchange with Laz : yes, DirectFB.
</I>&gt;<i> I think XVMC is far more advanced and should not be a real problem (and

</I>
At the moment, I'm just trying to get something that works before trying 
to incorporate it into anything... Eventually, I hope to create either 
another output driver for softdevice or incorporate it into the existing 
video-dfb.c (although that might be more difficult because libsoftmpeg 
takes care of the A-V sync and the actual audio and video output).

&gt;<i> &gt; I think I remember that the openchrome developers once search for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; someone who would integrate the mpeg2 hardware acceleration into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DirectFB, but obviously the didn't find anyone...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I remenber is DirectFB developers searching for someone to
</I>&gt;<i> integrate openchrome hardware decoding into DirectFB, removing X
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not read openchrome's ML, though, so you might also be right.
</I>
I have yet to get my head around how this would fit into either DirectFB 
or ffmpeg...

&gt;<i> &gt; What I can say is that the patch to ffmpeg to use the VLD-Xvmc is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rather small (it can be extracted from the mplayer patch on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; openchrome), so getting support form ffmpeg should not be difficult.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If that patch doesn't add X dependency (or run-time X dependency), that

</I>
Most of what I've seen depends heavily on X.
