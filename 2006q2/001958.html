<PRE>Right...here is a first attempt at a patch which incorporates hardware 
decoding into softdevice on via cle266 chipsets. It's a bit hacked together 
and requires a lot more work but as a first point it seems to work mostly.

Prerequisites: libcle266decode (see below for link), the library which 
provides the decoder access.

viafb: I'm using linux-viafb from DirectFB cvs from 18/4/06. My version 
includes Mark Adams' field sync patch. Not sure whether this would work with 
any other viafb. Probably not.

DirectFB and DFB++: both need patching with patches supplied in 
libcle266decode tarball (DFB++ one needs applying by hand at present but it 
involves adding about 2 lines: will fix at some point!). I'm using DirectFB 
and DFB++ from cvs on the 18/4/06 (not sure if anything drastic has changed 
since then). I've also patched with Mark Adams' field sync patch.

The patch is against softdevice cvs from 28/4/06. You will probably have to 
add -lcle266decode to the Makefile or config.mak. I have tried to enclose all 
of my additions in #ifdefs so you will also need to add -DCLE266HW to the 
Makefile. I think the only place where I didn't enclose with an #ifdef was in 
cDFBVideoOut::YUV because the compiler didn't like having #ifdefs within the 
try {} catch {} structures: they are there but commented out!

;)

Hopefully, the plugin should behave as normal unless it is called as 
-P'softdevice -vo dfb:cle266' Only MPEG-2 video is sent to the hardware 
decoder: anything else should still be decoded by ffmpeg, so things like 
softplay should hopefully work still (not tried yet!).

At present, this also enables viatv because I'm using TV-out for this.

At present, I get a smooth picture on my TV but it only occupies the top-left 
quarter of the screen! Total CPU usage has dropped from ca. 70-80% with 
software decoding to ca. 35% with my patch. It seems quite stable: it ran 
seamlessly over night without locking up.

The decoded frames end up in a DirectFB surface so I'm blitting these from 
here directly to the video surface, rather than copying to the avcodec 
structures. This means that there are some complaints where frame sizes are 
determined from the avcodec context (I commented out a few fprintfs from 
postprocessing steps)!

At the moment, this doesn't matter because I'm just blitting the whole frame 
rather than cropping, etc. This does mean that if, for example, the stream 
changes from 720x576 to 704x576, I end up with a strip of the previous few 
frames at the right-hand edge of my picture!

The video surface is forced to YV12 pixel format so that this blit can take 
place. N.B. I get a picture with swapped round red and blue (or something) if 
I select YV12 without the hardware decoding but then it has always been like 
that for me.

Patch:
<A HREF="http://vdr.club-burniston.co.uk/softdevice_cle266.diff">http://vdr.club-burniston.co.uk/softdevice_cle266.diff</A>

Decoder library:
<A HREF="http://vdr.club-burniston.co.uk/libcle266decode-0.1.tar.gz">http://vdr.club-burniston.co.uk/libcle266decode-0.1.tar.gz</A>

This is looking quite promising but still needs a lot of work...

Current problem is trying to work out why I only get a quarter-sized 
frame...if anyone has any clues, please let me know! Both the decoded frame 
buffer and the video surface are 720x576 so I'm not sure why only a quarter 
gets filled with video. The OSD itself fills the screen!

Cheers,

Laz
