Have you looked at the TV-out info on the softdevice web page:
<A HREF="http://softdevice.berlios.de/#TV-Out">http://softdevice.berlios.de/#TV-Out</A>

It was a while ago that I set my G450 up but I think it was pretty 
straightforward. Here's hoping that someone will correct me here!

One thing I _can't_ remember is whether the stock matroxfb in the kernel 
source works or whether it needs replacing with a different version 
(maybe someone else can enlighten us on this!). You will need a couple of 
patches which are to be found in the DirectFB source:

matroxfb-g400-clock-2.6.6.patch.bz2 (not quite sure what this one does)
matroxfb-full-memory-linux-2.6.6.patch.bz2 (this lets you use all of the 
RAM literally changes a couple of lines)

It looks like the matroxfb-vsync-irq patch has been included in the stock 
kernel so isn't needed now.

I made a component RGB cable from the schematics at:
<A HREF="http://forum.matrox.com/mga/viewforum.php?f=52&amp;sid=a1c50e38759f99f96d4bf184cfef9c78">http://forum.matrox.com/mga/viewforum.php?f=52&amp;sid=a1c50e38759f99f96d4bf184cfef9c78</A>
(pretty sure it was the &quot;Scart-RGB cable for the Millennium G450&quot; one 
which I bodged from a lead pinched off an old monitor.

Apart from that, I think I just built CVS DirectFB, CVS softdevice and it 
all just worked, apart from I was seeing lots of horizontal lines when 
scaling to a 4:3 TV (fixed by setting softdevice to 16:9 and setting my 
TV to 16:9 or 4:3 as needed!), although I think that has been resolved 
now.

As I mentioned in a previous posting it was working perfectly until I 
updated softdevice a few weeks back. Now the A-V sync sometimes wanders 
and interlaced streams aren't always smooth. Yet to track down the cause 
of this...

Cheers,

Laz
