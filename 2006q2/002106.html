I've just updated to current cvs on the Via system to see if that makes 
any difference.

&gt;<i> &gt; I've just done another couple of quick tests, both with dfb output:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; VideoFilter stuff) patched for the OSD fix only; set to 16:9 aspect

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	I get the sideways squashed image as I described.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whats does &quot;squashed&quot; mean in your case ?
</I>
It is a 4:3 picture transmitted with black borders at the left and right 
to make it up to 16:9 frame size. With viatv output, it is being squashed 
sideways into the size of a 4:3 frame (keeping the black borders), so 
that the picture itself is squashed sideways.

&gt;<i> In my case (radeon-vga), it looked like the video is not shifted left

</I>&gt;<i> horizontally was jumpy (only changed zoom factor). That should mean put
</I>&gt;<i> to value 8 or 9 only vertical zoom was done and with value 9 or 10 ther
</I>&gt;<i> was a bigger horizontal zoom jump.
</I>
With my setup, it shouldn't be doing any cropping or zooming because it 
has already been put into a 16:9 frame. The aspect ratio of the pictures 
may be 4:3 but the whole frame is 16:9. On a 4:3 display, this would want 
expanding up to fill the screen (removing the borders) but on a 16:9 it 
just wants displaying as 16:9 with its black borders, unless the user 
wants it expanded up with cropping or something.

&gt;<i> &gt; mgatv: softdevice cvs from 25/03/06 (I've gone back to an older
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version on there before the mmx bits were removed); set to 16:9 on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4:3 TV set to 16:9, all croppping turned off:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	Both play back fine with the correct aspect ratio!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is this down to how the AFDs are handled?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are the transmitted AFDs even correct?!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They seem to be correct transmitted, recognized and handled, at least
</I>&gt;<i> in common code. Syslog messages are the same and of the _expected_
</I>&gt;<i> values.
</I>
Hmmmmm...I'm just adding some debugging bits to video.c to see what it is 
doing. This sort of 'older' transmission used to work so maybe they are 
being transmitted with a different AFD now, or something like that!

Not quite sure when I'll get the time to test this, though.

Cheers,

Laz
