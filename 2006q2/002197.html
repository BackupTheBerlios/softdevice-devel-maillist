I'm in the UK on DVB-T too. What do you mean by '80 or 120 ms'? All I have 
with dfb output is an integer value. Do you mean +8 and +12? I've usually got 
bored changing it before getting to the best value so I tend to just live 
with the video being slightly ahead. I'll try your values, though. Any 
thoughts on why it should be needed in the UK?

&gt;<i> The delay is just added to the a/v sync code, so that with a positive

</I>
So a more positive value moves the audio forward relative to the video? Just 
looking at cAudioStreamDecoder::GetPTS(). The offset*10 gets added to the 
audio pts so that the audio is slowed down relative to the video so that the 
video and audio pts values match. Or that's how I see it!

I thought the A/V Delay was an &quot;audio delay&quot; and the other way round, from 
what someone said on this list the other day.

Cheers,

Laz
