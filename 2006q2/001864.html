If that would happen, I'm allocating it again few lines below to the
original size of AVCODEC_MAX_AUDIO_FRAME_SIZE, but if it would occur
indeed, the whole thing would repeat itself, so you're right it would be
ugly.
I'm just wondering if it _really_ would happen. From the debugging I've
done when trying out my patch I've seen that the length of the
audiosamples is actually 2304 (or something like that) for mono streams,
and exactly double for stereo, and both figures are really far, far away
from AVCODEC_MAX_AUDIO_FRAME_SIZE which is 192000.

&gt;<i> I would prefer the first version with extension that our initial buffer
</I>&gt;<i> is allocated with 2*AVCODEC_MAX_AUDIO_FRAME_SIZE .
</I>
Of course, memory allocation should happen preferably only once. You
know your project and ffmpeg internals far better and can judge if
2*AVCODEC_MAX_AUDIO_FRAME_SIZE is not too large. On the other hand, is
there some other place where the length of the sample itself is set? I
mean, wasn't an overflow possible without my UpmixMono patch, is it
taken care of it dynamically already and checked that the lenght is
never larger, or was it just assumed that AVCODEC_MAX_AUDIO_FRAME_SIZE
will be enough due to its large value? If so, I wouldn't fear about mono
samples too much, the risk would be the same, unless the other
assumption is true and that chunk length is checked against
AVCODEC_MAX_AUDIO_FRAME_SIZE right at the place where it is fed to
softdevice. Don't know if it's even possible to have an influence on
that dynamic length (or is it dynamic, who sets it?)...
