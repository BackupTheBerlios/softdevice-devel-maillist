I'd not seen any traffic in a long while and was pleasantly surprised! I'm 
still happily using softdevice with a Matrox G450.

Good stuff. I'll try to test it over the next few days...

&gt;<i> It is not stable and sometimes it does not show video for some old

</I>&gt;<i> Other disappointing thing is cpu consumption. Even my &quot;AMD 64 X2 5600+&quot;

Where I am (uk), we still don't have any terrestrial HD channels (can get 
them from satellites, though). Until I can receive HD easily, I don't want 
to have to build a meaty vdr box to handle the HD stuff or delve into 
VDPAU or similar.

Looking at your patch, I think I'll have to undo some of the resolution 
changes you've made for HD!

&gt;<i> Output method must be restructred, as decoding and displaying is done
</I>&gt;<i> in one thread (if I read the sources correct).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I won't promise to much, but let's see what could be done.
</I>
Sounds good. I've always much preferred the way softdevice doesn't require 
X to be running because it's one fewer layers to go wrong! There was some 
interest a few weeks back on the vdr mailing list about creating an output 
plugin that can provide output without X when softdevice has been doing it 
for years!

Unfortunately, I think VDPAU and similar are tightly integrated into X, 
which is a pain. I don't think it's possible to feed frames to the VDPAU 
libraries and output directly to a frame buffer but I could be wrong!

Cheers,

Laz
