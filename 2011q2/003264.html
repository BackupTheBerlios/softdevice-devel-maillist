Hi,

I was beginning to think that softdevice was no longer being developed but 
was pleased to see a couple of CVS updates.

Has anyone had any success with using softdevice with any versions of vdr 
more recent than 1.7.0? This was when the change to TS happened.

Whenever I've tried it, I get sound but no video. I've not delved too 
deeply into this (and it was a while back that I tried this) because I was 
thinking that development on softdevice had stopped and it would probably 
never work with newer vdr versions.

Has anyone had any success with this? Presumably the decoding by 
libavcodec would still work the same but softdevice might need a bit of 
tweaking to extract frames properly from the TS?

Cheers,

Laz
