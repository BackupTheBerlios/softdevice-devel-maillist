the A-V sync should not have changed... Did you try to go back to AVPatch01?

which is another output option for me; but it can't do 'head on/off'
like vdr-xine can do.  I guess thats all thats missing for me to
switch my setup to directfb..

Currenlty I think it is not need as this could be done in hardware
(matrox, radeon & via-epia).

Libavformats version number changed a few days (chg. on 2005-06-03)
after they changed this function prototype (chg. on 2005-05-30).
By this our version check fails if your checkout date is in between

Just don't know whats wrong here. Please give a newer ffmpeg version a try.

support only this as max resolution on both DVI connectors.

With current code and number and size of buffer we use, I expect some
difficulties with HDTV resolutions. Matrox cards only have 32MB :-) .

Found the reason, but not the fault :-) .
Reported display time is very strange:

[dfb] Display frame time is 99949 microseconds

As a hack I set that to 16667. There should be some bounds check or some
more measurement points.

This strange display time is reproducable after each reconfigure.

[dfb] (re)configured 0x08100609
[dfb] Display frame time is 99949 microseconds
[dfb] Display frame time is 99950 microseconds

I cannot say very much about sync as audio out seems to broken.
Both active speaker sets are nearly and almost silent. But there
are no '+' chars written for skipping frames.

Cpu load is around 45% for recordings (no tuner connected) 1GHz Nehemia.

which supports from specs 1920x1024, but with largest resolution 
1024x768 mentioned in the manual. Don't know how that works together.

But paying around 1350 euros for that, is an other story, even if that
one supports a 2:2 pull down recovery (mentioned in german user
manual only).

Unfortunately this works only, if you use directfb's remote .

Softdevice uses only hardware acclerated functions from directfb such as
scaling etc, no actual decoding.

MPEG4/H.264 decoding is supported by ffmpeg, but i think you muste use
some dual xeon system or better to get 720p/1080i H.264 material
decoded.

             timings <pixclock> <left> <right>  <upper>  <lower> <hslen> <vslen>

htotal = 106 + 768 + 1 + 70 = 945 (pixels)
vtotal = 44  + 576 + 1 + 4 = 625 (lines)

So that should be 945 * 67723 = 63998235 picoseconds * 625 lines,
which is about 39.998896875ms frame duration.

Is that a monitor device or tv device ?
Only tv devices should get a sync. The disadvantage is that I don't
know how to select field parity in that mode .

decoder decodes slices rather than frames: the input stream is broken into 
the relevant slices, these are fed into the decoder, the decoding is 
initiated, and then the slices are read back out and combined into a frame. 
Now, I'm not totally sure whether the data can be read back from the decoder 
or whether it goes directly to a framebuffer from there, somehow!

It doesn't look like mtest has been touched since 2004. I think Ivor's 
libddmpeg has been replaced by the Unichrome project which is a driver for 
Xorg.

Has anyone made any more progress with this or am I starting from scratch? 
Ultimately, the best route would probably be to incorporate hardware decoding 
into ffmpeg or similar but, for now, I'd just be happy to get it working from 
softdevice!

:)

Cheers,

Laz

I think XVMC is far more advanced and should not be a real problem (and
you mention patches to ffmpeg that should add XVMC to softdevice without
much work or no work at all in softdevice).

What I remenber is DirectFB developers searching for someone to
integrate openchrome hardware decoding into DirectFB, removing X
dependencies.
I do not read openchrome's ML, though, so you might also be right.

If that patch doesn't add X dependency (or run-time X dependency), that
would be great !

Whats your setting for OSD drawing ?

Did a short test Xv-out, expand set to max (25), OSD pseudo and
no crash happend.

small, so in my opinion we can merge it into the softdevice as soon as
it works stable and the above issue is solved. I also remember that you
used the SetupStore for some global variables which weren't really setup
options. Please don't do that, especially the index of the next picture
doesn't belong there.

Bye,
Martin

unichrome driver would report capability DLCAPS_ALPHACHANNEL. Reporting
DLCAPS_ALPHACHANNEL has to be fixed in DirectFB/gfxdrivers/unichrome/uc_overlay.h
line 5 or 6, by or'ing this together with other flags .

I got the famous sig-11 ). The first OSD was shown, but I guess the OSD 
refresh gets active, while the first video frame is about to be displayed.

Got the update, now it seems to be impossible to turn deinterlacing on:
[softdevice] Audio out seems to be OK
[softdevice] A/V devices initialized, now initializing MPEG2 Decoder
warning unsupported pixel format(22)!
[softdevice] error, libavcodec deinterlacer failure
[softdevice] switching deinterlacing off !

Will try that soon.

* There are different hardware variants of the Unichrome chips.  Since
  the revision number can only be read by superuser processes, a utility
  'find_revision.sh' is provided.  The value it reports should be used
  in /etc/directfbrc in a line of the form 'unichrome-revision=xx'.
  
  Symptoms of an incorrect revision number are corrupt images on the
  video overlay layer or incorrect colors when using YUY2 or YV12
  pixel formats.

Ah, yes I see. I forgot that for mgatv the default is YUY2, I thought
that it is I420. Of course YV12 is faster compared to YUY2...

Why is YUY2 is the default at all? Is the OSD not working at all or is
only the StrechtBlitting not working?

Scaling LUT44 makes not much sense, the quality would be very low
because of the limited colors. The simplest and fastest solution one
could do, would be to skip or repeat pixels. To adopt the existing
scaling routines to indexed bitmaps would be dead slow, and probably
still have a limited quality.
I saw that you implemented ScaleVUpXXXLut() and ScaleVDownXXXLut(), that
is not needed, if you don't scale only a CopyToBitmapLut() should be enough.
But without scaling there probably will be complaints again because of
the shift of the menu cursor and the menu when using the DVD-plugin.

No, either we apply the DFB part and the OSD part together or nothing. I
don't want to have some code in the softdevice which is not used and
probably never will be used.
What I wanted to say is, if you agree with Stefan on the DFB part, I
don't mind if we add the OSD part (maybe with some modifications...).

rev 7877 : muxing packets with unknown timestamps is not allowed
rev 7879 : iam pretty sure send time is dts and not pts ...

Would you like to do some further checks?
Does revision 7876 still work?
If answer is yes which of above revision kicks us ?
If answer is no, I've to guess some more.

Whats your setting for OSD drawing ?

Did a short test Xv-out, expand set to max (25), OSD pseudo and
no crash happend.

After switching from vdr 1.6.0 and softdevice 2008-02-26 to vdr 1.6.0-1 =

Stopped messages are usually caused by pressing CONTROL-Z.

Command "fg" brings suspended (stopped) processes back to foreground
of controlling terminal.

If you want to detach a suspended (stopped) process, command "bg"
background can be used to append and "&" to previous issued command.
