<PRE>Hello,

I am using VDR 1.3.36 and softdevice 0.2.1 and have a couple issues.  I have read through the archive and have not found the resolution as of yet, so I hope that someone could give me some ideas.  This is all done on a system with a Nexus-s and a &quot;New Grey Remote&quot;, and a Matrox G450.

1st problem I am having which I did read a little about is the remote does not seem to finction correctly.  When using softdevice with DFB the remote is found and I can teach it, but several buttons are not found (Blue button, Play button, and Record button).  Everything else seems to work, but those buttons, and a get double clicks half of the time, meaning if I am on channel 100 and I push channel up once it will go to channel 102.  

2nd Problem is while using vidix.  The picture works fine as does the remote, but I get no OSD at all.  I have tried this using i420 and yuv2.  I cannot get this to work for anything.

3rd problem I am having is the biggest pain.  I am going out dvi from a matrox directly to a 42&quot; Plasma, and there is about 3 rows of unused pixels all the way around the screen.  When I crop the top to get rid of the annoying flickering I get about 5 or 6 rows of unused pixels. 

Thanks for any advice.
