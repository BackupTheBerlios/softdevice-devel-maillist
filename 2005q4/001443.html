That would be wasted connectors. But perhaps a small LCD-touchscreen
device as 2nd monitor, so that you don't need to poweron the big one.
I wish that I would have more time for these nice things.

I went through the mail admin dialogs, but didn't find a hint for such
processing. Could you take that out, and we'll see if your mails get archived.

Sometimes cpu usage is not easy to understand. HD divx plays fine here
too, but 1980x1080i (h264) is a quite different story :-( . TV-stations gave
us the chance to think of further investment, until DVB-S2 recivers are
available. To my knowledge a 3G P4 is required for software decoding
and I would like to know if 2G P-M would be enough too.
