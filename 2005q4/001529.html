</I>I guess no. The reason for this initial off sync is that the video
stream is ahead of the audio stream (to give some time for the
decoding). The softdevice starts displaying the video as soon as it has
the first frame, which is before it has the corresponding audio.
The video is then played slower until audio and video is in sync again.
I changed this once so that the video waits for the audio, but I got
some complaints about slower channel switching times. I took that change
back soon since I too like the faster channel switching.

</I>&gt;<i> Sure, you can't avoid all context switches.  For instance, at 75 Hz frame

</I>&gt;<i> You'll get 13 context switches per frame, although you only need one.  If

</I>&gt;<i> you'd get 2.3 context switches per frame (one for the RTC timer interrupt
</I>&gt;<i> and 1.3 for the kernel scheduling interrupt).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I fear the RTC timing in the softdevice is not that sophisticated. The
softdevice programs the RTC to send something every 1ms and then reads
from /dev/RTC until the waiting time has passed. So there is a context
switch every 1ms.
Your description matches more the signal timing, there we actually have
only one context switch per wait, but it depends on the kernel timer
resolution.
