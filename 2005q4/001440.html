<PRE>Hi,

I am surprised straight whether you are really using depth=32 since your
fb mode &quot;1280x720-60&quot; only uses 16bit.

Did you post a wrong modeline or am i missing something ?

Greetings,

Subject: Re: [Softdevice-devel] Rescaling for a large LCD TV

Hi Stefan,

I finally managed to implement your hints, and voila: it works. 

Setup: 
BenQ DV3250 LCD TV w/ various inputs (DVI, PC, 2x Scart, YUV, etc. etc.)
G550 w/ DVI out Asus A7V8X board w/ VT8235 sound w/ SPDIF bracket
softdevice-0.2.0 directfb 0.9.22
vdr-1.3.26
DVI-D cable between G550 and TV set. Nix TV out and such things. 

/etc/fb.modes:
mode &quot;1280x720-60&quot;
   # D: 74.25 MHz, H: 45.00 kHz, V: 60.00 Hz
   geometry 1280 720 1280 720 16
   timings 13468 220 110 20 5 40 5
endmode

/etc/directfbrc:
mode=1280x720
depth=32
pixelformat=ARGB

in runvdr it says: 
VDRCMD=&quot;$VDRCMD -P 'softdevice -ao alsa:pcm=plug:spdif#ac3=plug:spdif#
-vo dfb:'&quot;

Soooooo - 

PAL TV (720x576) is rescaled fine to 960x720. A widescreen broadcast
just some minutes ago on ZDF is displayed as widescreen (1280x720)
automatically. I don't need to change the scaling on the TV set itself.
It displays everything in its native resolution (&quot;Real&quot;). This does not
work using the FF card's composite out - there I need to reselect the
resolution every other broadcasting. Here it's automatic. This is great!


Wow. 

The CPU is an Athlon XP 2400+ running at 1800 MHz natively. By now I
only see little artifacts and staircase patterns (no action film yet).
CPU load is between 65 and 70% all the time. 

Question: does this line

Nov  1 22:48:25 linvdr vdr[10694]: [VideoOut]: 720x576 [0,0 720x576] -&gt;
1280x720 [0,0 1280x720]

mean the broadcasting was sent in 720x576 and is rescaled to 1280x720?
How do they broadcast widescreen in 720x576? No black bars here. And 

Nov  1 23:16:44 linvdr vdr[10694]: [VideoOut]: 720x576 [0,0 720x576] -&gt;
1280x720 [160,0 960x720]

means a normal 4:3 720x576 picture is rescaled to 960x720 and offset by
160 pixels? 

How much horsepower does the rescaling need compared to decoding HDTV? 


&gt;<i> After having a look at the user manual, the BenQ devices are rather 
</I>&gt;<i> limited in possible display resolutions. They mention only very few 
</I>&gt;<i> resolutions for graphic input. the largest is 1024x768 :-( . All of 
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned resolution have refresh rates &gt;= 60 Hz .
</I>
60 Hz actually helped but don't mix'em up with the 3250 which really
works fine here. And the colours are much more realistic that with that
crappy composite signal - which can best be seen watching human skin
tones. Using the composite out skins sometimes look like on poorly
rendered 8-bit GIF images. 

Sound: the DD receiver shows a DD signal on ZDF all the time. I'm using
a coax cable from the Asus SPDIF bracket to the receiver. 

I hope I won't need to go back to composite. 

Next is replacing the FF card by another budget card and setting up
LIRC.
And getting a faster CPU to have some horsepower left for HDTV. I'm
trying to get an Athlon XP 3200+ @ FSB 333 (the board can't do FSB400).
This CPU was made as a special OEM design for HP, and they pop up on
eBay from time to time.
