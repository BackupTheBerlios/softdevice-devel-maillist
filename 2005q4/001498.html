Don't worry yet! It may be down to vdr and not softdevice, although sometimes 
it seems to take a few seconds to return to live TV when I stop a recording. 
What I saw was vdr restarting rather than a total bomb-out with a seg fault 
from DirectFB. It may have just been 'one of those odd occasions' but I'll 
get it going through gdb and wait to see if it happens again. On second 
thoughts, I'll modify my startup script so that it appends the tail of the 
output to a log file when it restarts.

My ffmpeg is CVS from a few days back, following a discussion on here last 
week!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But perhaps we can act on that, if we know that a stillpicture is from

Oooo...I like.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think I'll rename 'usUnichrometv' to 'viatv'. That is not hardware
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; vendor VIA, just a mor general via, as that mode just does:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - changes double buffering from double to triple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Go for it: better to keep the code consistent!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Perhaps I have to add a separate option which enables
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; triple buffering and viatv switches to trple buffering too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the moment I'll place that buffering on commandline only
</I>&gt;<i> -vo:triple
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I know why I commented out the triple buffering mode for BES.
</I>&gt;<i> That was originally a patch from Torgeir and I had problems with it.
</I>&gt;<i> I see some problems now when I enable triple buffering on matrox
</I>&gt;<i> BES. Stuttering video like every 2nd frame is skipped (no '+' chars
</I>&gt;<i> written).
</I>
Fair enough. So will this become a case of '-vo viatv,triple'?

Cheers,

Laz
