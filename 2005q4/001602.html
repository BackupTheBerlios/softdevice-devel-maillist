<PRE>I did try xv few days ago, but it did not seem to make a difference and in addition, HD content would be resized to small window in the corner. Also xv is not something I'm interested in as a long term solutions. I wanna get a true STB experience out of my box.

In a mean time, I've updated to DirectFB, DFB++ and softdevice, all cvs, and it did seem to make some difference. Some HD channels play OK (at best) while others don't, but any increase in postprocessing quality will result in similiar problems as before on all channels. so is my processor really too slow? I can't go much higher then what I have. AMD Athlon64 3700+, 1GB DDR Ram (Dual Channel).

As for the clips, I think the 2 that don't play well are corrupted as I get errors in syslog when I play them back, and I don't see the same errors when I play the first clip. I'll do more testing on that. Quality of playback through softdevice is about the same as through softdevice.

Right now I'm awaiting arrival of a Matrox G450, maybe this will improve performance. I'll keep you posted.

One more thing. On the HD channels that play OK, anything that have faster scenes (ex. car driving or anything that moves faster then 3 miles/hour) the picture looks very jerky (not smooth). it's pretty bad. Could this be a software problem or is it again cpu performance issue.

thanx

You could try to use Xv-Video out (I think I remember you use
DirectFB...), we have some reports of working HDTV with Xv-Video out.
But I'm not sure if it makes a difference...

Bye,
Martin
