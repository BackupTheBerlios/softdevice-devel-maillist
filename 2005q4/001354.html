<PRE>Hi folks,

I made up some Gentoo ebuilds for the 0.9.22 series of several DirectFB
projects, including for 0.9.23 which is now in CVS. Some of them of
course, have a different version pattern (DFBTutorials and the released
LiTE, which btw. requests DirectFB-0.9.23 already :-) ). For
linux-fusion I didn't know what other version to use than 0.9.23 as
there is no other way of getting it, than CVS. Btw, Denis &amp; co-devs,
would you mind having a look at the tiny patch I had to do for the
linux-fusion makefile, in order to make it work under gentoo (as the
depmod command is issued automatically ehen emerging kernel module
stuff). Could you accept that one?
<A HREF="http://www.muresan.de/DirectFB/linux-fusion_gentoo-makefile.diff">http://www.muresan.de/DirectFB/linux-fusion_gentoo-makefile.diff</A>

Now here is the list:
++DFB/
	++DFB-0.9.22.ebuild
	++DFB-0.9.23.ebuild

DFB++/
	DFB++-0.9.22.ebuild
	DFB++-0.9.23.ebuild

DFBTutorials/
	DFBTutorials-0.5.0.ebuild

DirectFB/
	DirectFB-0.9.22.ebuild
	DirectFB-0.9.23.ebuild

DirectFB-examples/
	DirectFB-examples-0.9.22.ebuild
	DirectFB-examples-0.9.23.ebuild

DirectFB-extra/
	DirectFB-extra-0.9.22.ebuild
	DirectFB-extra-0.9.23.ebuild

FusionSound/
	FusionSound-0.9.22.ebuild
	FusionSound-0.9.23.ebuild

LiTE/
	LiTE-0.3.1.ebuild

linux-fusion-cvs/
	linux-fusion-cvs-0.9.23.ebuild
	files/
		linux-fusion_gentoo-makefile.diff


To get the ebuilds, just unpack
<A HREF="http://www.muresan.de/DirectFB/DirectFB_gentoo-ebuilds.tar.bz2">http://www.muresan.de/DirectFB/DirectFB_gentoo-ebuilds.tar.bz2</A> in your
portage overlay folder, and generate digests before attempting to emerge
anything, but please read ahead first.

So if you want to use just 0.9.22 stuff, just mask the 0.9.23 out. If
you're curious and look in the ebuilds themselves, you'll notice that
they're identical. So these ebuilds are able to fetch either the
released versions or from CVS, controlled by the following USE flags
(they're also included in profiles/use.local.desc):

cvs_directfb cvs_dfbpp cvs_ppdfb cvs_dfbfusionsound cvs_dfblite
cvs_dfbextra cvs_dfbexamples cvs_dfbtutorials

The cvs_ flags are independent to allow mixing (you should know what
you're doing, sometimes this only works with equal versions) released
projects with CVS projects.

Further flags: voodoo unique trace extra-warnings ieee-floats accuracy
lite swfdec mpeg3

Please report dependency problems (proposals for the proper library
versions welcome) especially with DirectFB-extra, on which avifile,
libmpeg3 and swfdec failed on my X-less box, Openquicktime is blocked by
libquicktime which I need for transcode, didn't test yet libsvg-cairo,
will try it on my desktop box, but hey, the important thing for mew was
that df_xine is working :-D .


Have phun,
Lucian
