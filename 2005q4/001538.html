</I>I have a Gainward FX5200 that works well with NVidia's closed source 
XF86 drivers. The s-video out is not that good quality, it is worse than 
dxr3, but I've ordered a LCD display with HDMI input so I expect to get 
improvement :^) My FX5200 has smaller available resolution from DVI 
compared to VGA but I checked that at least 720p works trough DVI. 1080p 
wouldn't work trough DVI. I'm not sure about 1080i, but I don't want any 
more nasty de-interlacing and re-interlacing effects I suffer from now 
with s-video.

I remember reading from somewhere that there is an upper limit for DVI 
resolution that is not card specific. Hires DVI monitors are fed with 
two DVI cables and the driver card must be dual-head like. Is that true?

&gt;<i>Am I on the right track? Any other card worth looking into?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Probably, I have been happy so far. The next challenge will be to try to 
match the panel native resolution (1368x768) with DVI. I have heard 
rumours that something like 1366x768 or 1360x768 could work with Nvidia 
if 1368 is not possible. 720p should at least work.

With current Softdevice CVS I have a problem with new XV color 
adjustments. In default 50 value I get almost black and white picture. I 
must adjust after each vdr restart the controls to about 90 as 
softdevice doesn't store the setttings currently.

The subject line is about Xvmx. I tried that with vdr-xine but I got 
occasional crashes so I used also with vdr-xine just Xv. AFAIK 
softdevice doesn't support Xvmc.

BR,
Seppo
