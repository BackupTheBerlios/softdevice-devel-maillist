I haven't had a seg fault yet but vdr did restart at one point. I think this 
was on an aspect change after stopping playback of a recording.

No: from a few weeks back when I was testing other stuff trying to get proper 
field sync.

&gt;<i> &gt; maybe it isn't yet _quite_ as good as it could be but is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; big improvement over what I have had. One thing I have noticed is that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pausing can give a very flickery picture, looking like it is alternating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; between two fields, or frames, or the sync is reversing, or something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thats normal when displaying interlaced still pictures (both fields
</I>&gt;<i> at the same time).
</I>
I know it'll never be perfect but I'm still convinced that it is worse than it 
should be! I can live with it, though!

:<i>)
</I>
&gt;<i> I think I'll rename 'usUnichrometv' to 'viatv'. That is not hardware
</I>&gt;<i> vendor VIA, just a mor general via, as that mode just does:
</I>&gt;<i> - enables field parity for primary layer
</I>&gt;<i> - changes double buffering from double to triple
</I>
Go for it: better to keep the code consistent!

&gt;<i> Perhaps I have to add a separate option which enables
</I>&gt;<i> triple buffering and viatv switches to trple buffering too.
</I>
Maybe it would be better as s setup option but maybe not one of the ones on 
the new 'front setup menu'. Not sure where it would go, though! Are the 'Use 
StretchBlit', 'OSDalphablend', and 'Pixel format' still on the front page? 
Maybe they could go in a sub-menu with the buffering option.

Cheers,

Laz

&gt;<i> Just unified some actions of setting field parity (mga + via).
</I>
Cool.
