<PRE>Hi Ari,

&gt;<i> &gt; Often, there is several seconds of delay between pressing a key on the remote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; control and any effect on the screen.  The menu cursor is drawn at a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; slightly wrong place, and sometimes it is not drawn at all, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arrow keys and the OK key work nevertheless.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know if I'm using the dvd plugin actively but atleast that's
</I>&gt;<i> the only DVD player that I use. I haven't experienced any crashes but
</I>&gt;<i> some of your symptoms sound familiar. The user interface is not very
</I>&gt;<i> responsive to remote control buttons for me either.
</I>
A little update, after testing 80% of my DVD collection, consisting of
3 disks and two borrowed ones. :-)  The disks played fine on a different
computer on vlc using the wxvlc frontend packaged for Debian.

There's an annoying bug in fast-forward: it will sometimes stuck, especially
if a clip is fast-forwarded to the end (in which case the clip will usually
restart from the beginning).  I guess this is a bug in the dvd plugin itself.

In menus, the navigation cursor was never shown at the correct place,
no matter which crop mode or screen aspect ratio I selected.  In some
crop mode setting, the displacement was small - a couple of pixels near
the top or left of the screen, and maybe 20 pixels when the cursor
position was closer to the right or bottom of the picture.

In some menus, the cursor will not appear at all, or the position will
not be updated.

By the way, the crop mode setting will not take effect in menus until
you change menu screens.  I only investigated this on a disk that had
static menu background, so this might not apply to animated menus.

&gt;<i> I use LIRC as input method.
</I>
I'm using the linuxinput driver of DirectFB (version 0.9.23 if I remember
correctly) and the Linux 2.6.13.4 cx88 driver for the remote control unit
of the Hauppauge Nova-T PCI 90002.
as follows:
&gt;<i> I remember also one hangup situation when the drive wouldn't eject the
</I>&gt;<i> disc out without first booting the computer.
</I>
The dvd plugin doesn't seem to handle read errors gracefully.  I got a
bad hang when playing one home-burned DVD at 9&#215; speed until a read error
occurred.  The kernel kept spitting some read error messages, and vdr
could not be killed for a long time.  It might even have been that the
disk wouldn't eject until I pressed the reset button.

I also got hangs when trying to play the non-existent track 14
of &quot;El&#228;imellist&#228; menoa&quot; (Aardman Animations' Creature Comforts in Finnish
and Swedish &quot;Livets N&#246;dtorft&quot; or something like that).  The payload tracks
are 1 through 13, and track 15 is the intro animation.  mplayer
<A HREF="dvd://14">dvd://14</A> reports the following:

MPEG-PS file format detected.
MPEG: No audio stream found -&gt; no sound.
VIDEO:  MPEG2  720x576  (aspect 3)  25.000 fps  8000.0 kbps (1000.0 kbyte/s)
==========================================================================
Opening video decoder: [mpegpes] MPEG 1/2 Video passthrough
VDec: vo config request - 720 x 576 (preferred colorspace: Mpeg PES)
Could not find matching colorspace - retrying with -vf scale...
Opening video filter: [scale]
The selected video_out device is incompatible with this codec.
Also try adding the scale filter, e.g. -vf spp,scale instead of -vf spp.
VDecoder init failed :(
Opening video decoder: [libmpeg2] MPEG 1/2 Video decoder libmpeg2-v0.4.0b
Selected video codec: [mpeg12] vfm: libmpeg2 (MPEG-1 or 2 (libmpeg2))
==========================================================================
Audio: no sound
Starting playback...
VDec: vo config request - 720 x 576 (preferred colorspace: Planar YV12)
VDec: using Planar YV12 as output csp (no 0)
Movie-Aspect is 1.78:1 - prescaling to correct movie aspect.
VO: [xv] 720x576 =&gt; 1024x576 Planar YV12

The track is very short: the MPlayer window just flashes on the screen.

The title selection menu of this DVD is completely unusable on vdr-dvd.
The cursor is only shown on one position, even though different titles
can apparently be selected.  The menu works perfectly in wxvlc.

Would it help if I tested the dvd plugin on softdevice-xv?  I don't have
X11 on my vdr box, but I can install vdr and softdevice on another
(tuner-less) computer if needed.

Finally, one &quot;bug&quot; that I will have to fix: the vdr-dvd plugin ignores my
&quot;suspend&quot; flag: &lt;<A HREF="http://www.iki.fi/~msmakela/software/vdr/#suspend">http://www.iki.fi/~msmakela/software/vdr/#suspend</A>&gt;.
This is by design, because my patch stops the stream at the source,
either from the DVB tuner in cDevice::Action() or from the file system
in cDvbPlayer::Action().  A similar patch would have to be applied to
the read loop of the vdr-dvd plugin.

	Marko
