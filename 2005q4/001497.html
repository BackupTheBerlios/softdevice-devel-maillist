Segfault at aspect change ? We had that several time. Verify your 
ffmpeg version is new than mid of May.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Here you change the default for others from ONSYNC to WAITFORSYNC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess it's better to keep ONSYNC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Probably something hanging over from when I was testing stuff before: I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; was trying not to change anything else. Oops!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; After more testing,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is that the test you mentioned above ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No: from a few weeks back when I was testing other stuff trying to get proper 
</I>&gt;<i> field sync.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; maybe it isn't yet _quite_ as good as it could be but is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; big improvement over what I have had. One thing I have noticed is that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; pausing can give a very flickery picture, looking like it is alternating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; between two fields, or frames, or the sync is reversing, or something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; like that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thats normal when displaying interlaced still pictures (both fields
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at the same time).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know it'll never be perfect but I'm still convinced that it is worse than it 
</I>&gt;<i> should be! I can live with it, though!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> :)
</I>
But perhaps we can act on that, if we know that a stillpicture is from
interlaced video and we could display one field only.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think I'll rename 'usUnichrometv' to 'viatv'. That is not hardware
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vendor VIA, just a mor general via, as that mode just does:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - enables field parity for primary layer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - changes double buffering from double to triple
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Go for it: better to keep the code consistent!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps I have to add a separate option which enables
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; triple buffering and viatv switches to trple buffering too.
</I>
For the moment I'll place that buffering on commandline only
-vo:triple 

I think I know why I commented out the triple buffering mode for BES.
That was originally a patch from Torgeir and I had problems with it.
I see some problems now when I enable triple buffering on matrox
BES. Stuttering video like every 2nd frame is skipped (no '+' chars written).
