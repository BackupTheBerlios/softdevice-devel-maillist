<PRE>Hi,

I sent a much longer email to the list last night but it seems to have
disappeared down a big black hole!

I am setting up softdevice with a Matrox G450 dual-head card which I was
hoping would be much simpler than the Epia system I've also been working
on.

I can get df_xine and mplayer to output to my TV using a home-made
HD15-SCART RGB cable (although that needs modifying...). It was quite a
decent picture with no interlace artifacts or anything like that, so my
fb.modes and directfbrc can't be far off!

When I try to start vdr-1.3.32 with softdevice-0.2.0, all looks fine in
the output, i.e. it finds the CRTC2 layer for both OSD and video, and
gets as far as outputting:

cSoftDevice::MakePrimaryDevice

and then it stops and just sits there presumably waiting for something.

After reading back over archives of DirectFB and softdevice mailing
lists, I found mention where someone had a similar problem and it was
solved by setting the pixel format to YUY2. Looking at the source for
softdevice, the pixel format should be forced to YUY2 when &quot;-vo
dfb:mgatv&quot; is used.

I am not getting far enough to get any softdevice.x bits in my
setup.conf but I will try copying over that chunk from my Epia box and
force the pixel format to YUY2 to see if that makes any difference!

Can anyone shed any light on this?

I'm also losing control of the keyboard when I run a DirectFB
application, meaning I have to ssh in and kill df_xine after it has
finished playback or vdr once it is sitting there. This is probably a
separate issue though!

Cheers,

Laz
