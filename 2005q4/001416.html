Version 0.4.3 of the suspend patch
(<A HREF="http://www.iki.fi/~msmakela/software/vdr/vdr-1.3.34-suspend-0.4.3.patch.gz">http://www.iki.fi/~msmakela/software/vdr/vdr-1.3.34-suspend-0.4.3.patch.gz</A>)
defines the symbol VDR_SUSPEND in config.h.  You can define an inherited
method of cStatus::SetSuspended(bool) #ifdef VDR_SUSPEND.

Hmm, I don't see anything in softdevice that would inherit cStatus.  It
doesn't seem logical to have methods for notifying status changes (such
as audio volume level) in two places: in cDevice and in cStatus.

It is not trivial for me to add a cStatus listener to softdevice.  I don't
have any experience of softplay, as I only have DVB recordings on my vdr box.

Two reasons why it would be nice if softdevice listened to
cStatus::SetSuspended(bool) events:

(1) Blank the screen (make it black) immediately when playback is suspended.
The timeout-based method seems to be disabled when a recording is paused.

(2) It'd be nice to power the monitor on or off by DPMS (or trigger the
X11 screensaver on or off) based on whether the playback is suspended.

Only the (1) annoys me slightly, but (2) was requested by a softdevice
user.  I can't fix (2), as the monitor on my VDR system is a year or two
too old to obey DPMS.
