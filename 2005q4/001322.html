Yup, that was the one thing I forgot to ask. Display aspect ratio
has to be set correct. As it we are now talking about scaling, have a
look at my postings at directfb-user. There are some hard things
to be done ..

</I>
Well in ac3 mode, there seems to be a slight offset for a short while.
But a few seconds later the speaker seems to be lipsync again without
any noticable frame dropping.
Perhaps I'll delay that issue for a short time and release 0.2.0 version
very soon, hopefully this evening, so that people can do tests over 
the weekend.
