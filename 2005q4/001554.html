I got the impression that something has changed inside vdr.

Now:
I noticed that upon channel switch, audio seems to be ahead of video,
and after channel switch I get a few video frames dropped (+ chars written)

Previous:
Video was ahead of audio and after switching channels, some video frames
got an extra delay (slow motion).

A few days ago I did some vdr-1.2.1 tests with a streamdev connection
to my DVB-S server. Channel switching times were rather impressive
compared to my DVB-T vdr-1.3.34 development system.

Have to check since which vdr version this behavior changed.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How hard would it be to play video only until the first up-to-date audio
</I>&gt;<i> frame arrives?  Even some analog TV sets mute the audio during channel
</I>&gt;<i> zapping.
</I>
I would prefer not to change this adhoc (without user preferrences,
yet another option :-( ).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current behaviour is a bit irritating when you play recordings that
</I>&gt;<i> start with a program announcement showing a live picture of the announcer's
</I>&gt;<i> head.  The lip-sync will be lost for a few seconds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I fear the RTC timing in the softdevice is not that sophisticated. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; softdevice programs the RTC to send something every 1ms and then reads
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from /dev/RTC until the waiting time has passed. So there is a context
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; switch every 1ms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see, it uses the RTC as a source of 1ms time quantums.  I assumed that
</I>&gt;<i> you would constantly reprogram the RTC timer to expire at the next deadline,
</I>&gt;<i> but I guess it would be very hard to avoid jitter, as you'd need two context
</I>&gt;<i> switches per cycle: one to read the timer and another one to reprogram it.
