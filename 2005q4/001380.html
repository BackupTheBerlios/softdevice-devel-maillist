But it should have a mode where it fills the entire screen with the
720x576 source. Thats what my 7&quot; mini LCD does. In that mode, I set
monitor aspect to 16:9 and softdevice scales 4:3 aspect horizontally.

&gt;<i> The set also offers a letterbox mode which

</I>
Sometimes they do really strange things with movies. Thats why I
refused to buy one. Hopfully industry will offer LCD-TVs which support
our 50Hz (field-rate) PAL system. Up to now I've only seen LCDs which
are made for US/Japan 60Hz NTSC system. And don't trust anyone who
tells you something about some sophisticated pull-down/up techniques their
super LCD offers. Such technical play effects are _not_ required if they
would support our TV system.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mathematically, one could scale 720 horizontal pixels to 1360 (an integer

</I>
I guess you should just select 16:9 as display aspect via our OSD and
drive display in it's native 1366x768 mode.

Hm, I guess I should reintroduce OSD centering in all modes.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Question is: is that doable, and do I want to do that? Can / should

</I>
We have to set the correct parameters for scaling.

If there are problems, let us know which are actual scaling paramters.
They are reported via syslog.
