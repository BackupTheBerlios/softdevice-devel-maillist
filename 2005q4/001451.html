<PRE>I have been trying to get vdr (1.3.32) + softdevice (0.2.0) to work with
DirectFB (cvs from 281005) output on my Epia MII board with a vt1622a TV
encoder. I was trying to get Mark Adams field-sync stuff working
properly but this was giving me a weird, stuttering output which looked
like there was a timing issue or something, causing it to drop a field
every second or so, giving really bad A-V sync, presumably as it was
trying to compensate and catch up.

I set myself the task of implementing an additional Unichrome tv-out
driver (in the same vein as the -vo dfb:mgatv output) and lots of
testing, rechecking, more testing. With my settings, it enabled
DLOP_FIELD_PARITY. The implementation worked but I ended up with the
same stuttering output!

I also made some other changes to the rest of the code and found that I
had an almost perfect output when I disabled my DLOP_FIELD_PARITY bits!
What I had done was reenable a couple of sections of commented out code.
I have reenabled both DLBM_TRIPLE and DLOP_DEINTERLACING, if supported.

(Why were these commented out? What did they break? ;))

With this setup, i.e. triple buffering and deinterlacing enabled and
field parity disabled, I get a good picture. It doesn't look as smooth
as it might be, maybe, but that's probably because it isn't using the
field sync stuff. A-V sync is now perfect (with a delay of -3).

This is a serious improvement on what I was getting! Maybe getting
DLOP_FIELD_PARITY to work properly would be the icing on the cake but
for now it's good.

Cheers,

Laz
