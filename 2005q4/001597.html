<PRE>Hi,

as I wrote in an earlier mail, I am using softdevice (with a G550 card)
quite successfully. One of the real advantages of softdevice is its
crop mode that allows you to crop a 14:9 or 16:9 rectangle from a 4:3
broadcasting and rescale it to full screen on a 16:9 capable TV set
(1280x720). Really nice. The downside is that my current living room
machine is just not living room compatible (looks and noise). I would
like to build a new VDR with a mini-ITX board (CLE266 or CN400) and use
the xine libs and plugin.

The question is, does xine provide something similar? I suspect that the
answer is no because the rescaling needs to be done _after_ the MPEG2
decoding, which in case of the VIA chip is done in hardware. Is that
right or is there hope?

And - will xine rescale the picture to 1280x720 if it is encoded
anamorphous, as does softdevice?

Alternatively, how good is the CLE266/CN400 support in DirectFB? That would
be an alternative (with softdevice in turn). Has somebody been there, done
that? 

Most private TV stations in Germany simply don't get it as far as
anamorphous encoding...
