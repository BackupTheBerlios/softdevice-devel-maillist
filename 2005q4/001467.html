Nah - the VGA connectors are spare anyway.

Hehe - it's exactly for this purpose - to have both on the big display, and
I don't need another one. I tried vt-switching in directfbrc but it didn't
work for me. Question is, is there any setting that allows me to keep the
DFB on the 1st head (DVI) and the Linux console on the 2nd (VGA). Then I
can help debugging softdevice without buying another piece of hardware...

Wilco. 

&gt;<i> too, but 1980x1080i (h264) is a quite different story :-( . TV-stations gave

The next HD-TV broadcasting is mine. My XP-M 2400+ has apparently some
capacity left as far as overclocking. As far as I know 1080i will not be
used in DE country before long, but rather 720p. As I understand I do not
need to remove my FF card when PrimaryDVB points at softdevice, right?
