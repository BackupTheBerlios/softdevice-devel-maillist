</I>&gt;<i> I recently started using softdevice with directfb. I was succesfull in setting up a 1280x720 resolution on my old system with a PCI version of ATI 9200SE using radeonfb driver connected to my 50&quot;DLP using a DVI. However, after upgrading to a new system, with a Nvidia GforceFX 5200, the same mode does not work anymore. As a matter of fact, no modes are displayed correctly using the nvidiafb driver. I thought that the correct mode matter to a TV set and not the card, so shouldn't the same mode work on both cards?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have a working setup using the nvididafb driver? If so, can you post your working fb,modes? I'm especially interested in the 1280x720 mode, but for now any working modes would be nic.

</I>&gt;<i> Note: Yes, I am aware of the conflict between nvidia drivers and directfb drivers so i'm running the system in console mode.

So you are trying with &quot;-vo fb:&quot; ?

Plain framebuffer mode is not well supported.
Only 16/15 bit modes work. 
Some month's ago I tried nvidia with someone from vdr-portal and
vidix-out &quot;-vo vidix:&quot;  drivers, but we were not succesful. I don't know
if that changed in between.

Only X11 with xv-out worked for him.

You should ask on directfb lists for state of nvidia drivers.
