After switching streams, in DFB the audio is off sync for a few seconds.
I wonder if the off-sync time is shorter in Xv out.

Sure, you can't avoid all context switches.  For instance, at 75 Hz frame
rate and no RTC timer, you'd be better off using the 1000 Hz kernel timer.
You'll get 13 context switches per frame, although you only need one.  If
you used the RTC timer, you could set the kernel timer to 100 Hz.  Then,
you'd get 2.3 context switches per frame (one for the RTC timer interrupt
and 1.3 for the kernel scheduling interrupt).

&gt;<i> &gt; Some day, I might figure out if there is a way to use softdevice RTC timing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and nvram-wakeup simultaneously.  Perhaps softdevice could release the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; timer device when the output is suspended, so that the wakeup timer can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; programmed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't check but I think just calling cmpeg2decoder::Stop() in
</I>&gt;<i> Suspend() and Start() in Resume() should be enough to do that.
</I>
Thanks, I'll try that when I get around to it.

On a related note&#185;, this week I rebuilt my wake-on-remote circuit
(<A HREF="http://www.iki.fi/~msmakela/electronics/worc5/">http://www.iki.fi/~msmakela/electronics/worc5/</A>) on a circuit board.
I'll publish the Eagle files and a photo as soon as I get the second
version of the circuit board (with improved layout) manufactured and
assembled and figure out a good way to mechanically attach the
circuit board on the tuner card.

&#185; Users of nvram-wakeup would probably like to power their system up
  by remote control.

The circuit has only been tested with the Hauppauge Nova-T PCI 90002,
but I believe that it can be hooked to any circuit that uses a three-wire
infrared receiver module.  My firmware only understands RC5 code.
Does anyone know if there is a DVB-C budget card with a bundled remote
control unit?  A friend of mine is interested in building a vdr box,
and he has DVB-C.
