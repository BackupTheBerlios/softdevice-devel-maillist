How hard would it be to play video only until the first up-to-date audio
frame arrives?  Even some analog TV sets mute the audio during channel
zapping.

The current behaviour is a bit irritating when you play recordings that
start with a program announcement showing a live picture of the announcer's
head.  The lip-sync will be lost for a few seconds.

&gt;<i> I fear the RTC timing in the softdevice is not that sophisticated. The
</I>&gt;<i> softdevice programs the RTC to send something every 1ms and then reads
</I>&gt;<i> from /dev/RTC until the waiting time has passed. So there is a context
</I>&gt;<i> switch every 1ms.
</I>
I see, it uses the RTC as a source of 1ms time quantums.  I assumed that
you would constantly reprogram the RTC timer to expire at the next deadline,
but I guess it would be very hard to avoid jitter, as you'd need two context
switches per cycle: one to read the timer and another one to reprogram it.
