Right.  Bypassing vdr would bring its own set of problems.  Examples of
current problems are vdr being unaware of softdevice.Suspended and
CropModeToggleKey.  (Did you or Stefan have a chance of looking at my
crash report of CropModeToggleKey detection already?)

&gt;<i> I would prefer to improve the cooperation of the dvd-plugin and the

</I>
Sure.  Starting from the scratch does not make sense unless there is some
fundamental problem with the current solution.  I'm glad there is none.

By the way, this may be a stupid question, but how can I contact the
authors of the vdr-dvd plugin?  It is not obvious from the SourceForge
project page &lt;<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dvdplugin/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/dvdplugin/</A>&gt;.  I did not find
any active mailing list.  I see that there is some activity going on:
the latest change in CVS is 3 months old.
