Don't know, at least I can't notice anything wrong with sound, and as it
turned out in the end, it doesn't even cause this judder, just read on ;-)

I first thought this is due to settings /etc/directfbrc or modelines in
/etc/fb.modes. Well, I had a line depth=32 in my directfbrc and
commented it out, with no difference to this output. Then I noticed, my
fb.modes had all modelines labeled like &quot;720x576 50Hz 16bit&quot;, but hey,
those are only labels after all. However, the number of reported video
modes is exactly the number of modelines from fb.modes, and after all, I
know that for CRTC2 this file is irrelevant, as the PAL and NTSC modes
are actually hard-coded in the CRTC2 gfxdriver by Ville (I think).

&gt;<i> I did my ac3 test on a similar system: normal old TV (no 100Hz box),
</I>&gt;<i> G400 dual head 32MB.
</I>&gt;<i> I definately don't see any judder effects news ticker of N24 runs fine
</I>&gt;<i> and deinterlaceing is turned off, as it is not needed on a interlaced tv.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can you try to change:
</I>&gt;<i> osdLayer-&gt;SetFieldParity(0);
</I>&gt;<i> to:
</I>&gt;<i> osdLayer-&gt;SetFieldParity(1);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> to see if fields are swapped on your card.
</I>
I tried that, and even to hack the similar code at a place where
videoLayer is configured, and it did not help. BUT, then I played again
with the softdevice setup options in the OSD!!!! Man, what a moron I was
when I did it some time ago and changed the aspect ratio, I had the
impression that 5:4 &quot;looked better&quot; on my 4:3 PAL TV (because of
overscan - btw, is there a way to tweak this for G400 CRTC2 used with
DirectFB?). Well, the moment I switched back to 4:3, the image became
crisp and clear, no judder, everything looks just as it should, only
once in a while there seems to be a synchronisation catch up where
horizontally scrolling text for example, speeds up a little bit and then
moves with constant speed again, but it's not too obviously noticeable.

So my judder issue is solved now, I'm curious if A/V sync can still be
improved.

On to the next, but I'll start another topic...
