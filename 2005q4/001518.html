</I>&gt;<i> I haven't experienced any A-V sync issues on DFB output lately.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>No, the audio is not synced at all, only the video is synced to the
audio. But DFB uses on top the video retrace (don't ask me how this
works in detail - I only use Xv out ;-)
I started working on a resampler which would make it possible to fine
tune the audio sample rate, but I stopped at some point... In fact the
resampler is finished, but the syncing code is still missing.

&gt;<i> I have the impression that improving the kernel timer resolution will cause
</I>&gt;<i> more context switches per time unit.  It'd be better to use a very low
</I>&gt;<i> kernel timer resolution and to use the RTC timer, as it will generate
</I>&gt;<i> interrupt events.  Am I correct about this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I would not call me an expert on this, but I think you will get context
switches no matter what method you use. Well maybe only as long as the
softdevice is reading from /dev/rtc, but I'm not sure. I prefer RTC
because it doesn't depend on the kernel timer and from some tests I did
I found that the RTC is more reliable and precise.

&gt;<i> Some day, I might figure out if there is a way to use softdevice RTC timing
</I>&gt;<i> and nvram-wakeup simultaneously.  Perhaps softdevice could release the
</I>&gt;<i> timer device when the output is suspended, so that the wakeup timer can be
</I>&gt;<i> programmed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I didn't check but I think just calling cmpeg2decoder::Stop() in
Suspend() and Start() in Resume() should be enough to do that.
