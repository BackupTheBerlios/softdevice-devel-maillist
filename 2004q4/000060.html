I tested this with vdr-1.3.15 and vdr-1.2.1.
with vdr-1.2.1 compile fails:

../../../include/vdr/ringbuffer.h: In member function `virtual void
   cStreamDecoder::Clear()':
../../../include/vdr/ringbuffer.h:34: error: `int cRingBuffer::Free()' is
   protected

I think there are some other issues even with newer vdrs due to
CondVar handling.

Pausing playback seems to take some longer time.
Audio sync in life mode is better.
I still have to do some more test .

I'm using that part of sync code, that has no rtc access. /dev/rtc
is in use by chronyd for network time syncing :-) .

For compalibility issues: is it possbile to have the new audio sync
concurrent with the old one, so that new code can be selected via &quot;#if some_thing&quot; ?

A minor issue towards coding style: could you please replace tabs with blanks
so that indentation (2 spaces) is kept independent of editor's tab settings ?

For EINTR handling in audio.c I'll commit a last change for 0.0.7 with &quot;continue&quot;
replaced by &quot;return&quot; .
