It looks like part of the frame is still one frame behind. You can see
it on horizontal pans easily. It only happens with matrox and I420 color
space.

That's why the native mode works best for me. My projector is 1280x720
and the setup in Xv works really well as long as the aspect ratio change
is detected. When the programme is in 4x3 black bars are added correctly
at the sides in Xv, that doesn't happen with 720x576 and dfb output.
Maybe a 1024x576 resolution is better. Will have to test it again. 

I usually keep the radeon in the machine as it has better black details,
which I attribute to the 10 bit per component resolution of the hw
scaler. The image of the matrox g450 also look too soft to my eye.

Incidentally, the judder problems I'm having, which I was due to the
extra indirection before the YUV data is actually sent to the hardware
caused by the X server process, is also present when using dfb output on
the matrox g450. So I am beginning to suspect it is caused by the
libavcodec decoding... The plot thickens...
