I had the problem with the broken OSD, seemed like it was linked to
the interlacing as only half was visible and it flickered like crazy.

If it works for you then I must be doing something stupid, which
wouldn't surprise me, as I'm flying by the seat of my pants where
linux is concerned. As the documentation is so limited, I've not been
sure that I've compiled things correctly, especially FFMPEG - I
followed the instructions &quot;For deinterlacing pp-filters in recent
plugin versions,....&quot; on the vdr wiki page for the plugin. But that
could have been talking about a totally different version or horribly
out of date (curse o' the wiki).

How did you compile FFMPEG?

&gt;<i> &gt; Should I be using &quot;-vo dfb:&quot; or &quot;-vo dfb:mgatv&quot; for my G450 with diy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vga to scart cable?  I should add that using &quot;mplayer -vo dfbmga&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shows the same lines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> vdr -P'softdevice -vo dfb:mgatv' works for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that if you sometimes test with VGA output, you will need a different
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/directfbrc.  I solved the problem by creating two /etc/directfbrc.*
</I>&gt;<i> files and symlinking the correct one to directfbrc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I only test on my TV so shouldn't need that - can make for angry
scenes where the partner needs access to big brother....

&gt;<i> &gt; I've picked up on work being done to ensue scaling of 16:9 interlaced
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; video to 4:3 tv works correctly, is this complete &amp; working now? I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; notice that if I set &quot;Screen Aspect&quot; to 16:9, although I'm missing a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lot of the image, and the aspect ratio is incorrect, there are no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lines like those mentioned above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before the field-based scaler, it used to be like that.  I use CropMode 4:3
</I>&gt;<i> on my 4:3 video monitor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If I set CropMode to 4:3 then the overscan is too severe. Even though
my TV is 4:3, I like to view in the 16:9 aspect ratio whenever
possible, ie there are black bars at the top and bottom. This is how I
want to watch dvds and dvb-t television, though I'm beginning to feel
like this it is going to be impossible to get this setup to be
compatible with hardware interlacing.

*If someone knows a definitive answer to this I would be greatful for the email.

&gt;<i> &gt; I would prefer not to use any software deinterlacing, as the main
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reason I bought this card was that everywhere I read I was told that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the card could do all this in hardware. Other than this current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem, the output is fantastic, although the audio does seem to lose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sync quite regularly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is the other hardware like?  I have a 900 MHz Celeron running on
</I>&gt;<i> VIA 686A chipset, tested with 128 MB and 256 MB RAM, one ATAPI hard disk
</I>&gt;<i> and two Nova-T PCI 90002 tuner cards.  It works most of the time, using
</I>&gt;<i> nvram-wakeup for timed recordings, but every couple of months, the board
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be powered off completely, because something in the PCI bus
</I>&gt;<i> controller goes bad.  The only fan is the CPU fan, which blows air directly
</I>&gt;<i> outside via a self-made duct.  Other than the size (a large tower case)
</I>&gt;<i> and the occasional chipset glitches, I'm very happy with the system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hardware is biostar nforce2 based motherboard, underclocked &amp;
undervolted athlon 2500 barton, 512MB ram, one atapi disk, two kworld
vstream dvb-t pci cards, all in an antec aria cube case which used to
get very hot and was really noisy until I replaced the PSU fan and
changed my heatsink fan. I have plans for another vdr box using a
passively cooled 900 Mhz celeron and a fanless psu but that can't
happen until I reach a perfect settlement to my g450 setup, or I find
someother way....
