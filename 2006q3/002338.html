Clip is still available if anyone is interested in trying it out - BBC
News 24 clip broadcast on UK DVB-T transmission.

I've been meaning to do more investigating on this, but things have
been tough this past month and my girlfriend is certain that she likes
vdr and that she doesn't want me messing about with it's inards!

I ended up using the Gentoo ebuilds to build my system from scratch
because I thought make things easier for me. However they have been
even less reliable than my own compiled setup so I'm going back to
running CVS versions etc.

I'd like to investigate the output using &quot;softdevice -vo dfb:&quot; as I
seem to rememebr that although the OSD was broken and there was a
mirroring of picture above and below the 'letter box' there were no
artifacts, and there was also an option to use the Fb-Intern(al)
de-interlacer. Does that have anything to do with the matrox's
Interlaced output(?).

Some sort of reply from the softdevice programmers or any one from
directFB would be useful in determining what could and couldn't work.
