Your patch might fix the &quot;long pause&quot; problem but not the hang that
I am experiencing.  My vdr-suspend patch simply stops the delivery
of MPEG packets to other than recorder threads.  Would it be possible
to reset and stop the timers in cMpeg2Decoder::Clear() as well?

As far as I know, several vdr packagers apply the vdr-suspend patch,
but the feature is disabled in the default configuration.  I am
afraid that several people could be affected by this.  Maybe the hang
only occurs in conjunction with the vdr-subtitles plugin when there
are DVB subtitles being displayed at resume time.

On the other hand, I may need to rework the vdr-suspend patch anyway.
In its current form, it does not work on full-featured cards, nor
does it blank the screen.  (It used to blank the screen on softdevice,
relying on its built-in blank timer.)

Me too.  Sometimes, I hit the Power button followed by some other button
to suspend the playback and to prevent the system from powering off.
Then, I'd hit the Power button to resume.

I would have believed that one hang occurred after a 40-minute suspension.
Could it perhaps be a signed counter, counting 1&lt;&lt;31 microseconds before
overflow?
