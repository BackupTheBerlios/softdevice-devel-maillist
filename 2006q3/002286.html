</I>
I've not got to the stage of getting the subtitles working yet, though
I'll make a note of this.

&gt;<i> Note that when compiling DirectFB from source, you should install DirectFB
</I>&gt;<i> first and only then compile and install DFB++.  Otherwise, DFB++ will
</I>&gt;<i> depend on the wrong DirectFB library.
</I>
Thats one of the few things I did right, made sense to compile in that order.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How did you compile FFMPEG?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ./configure --extra-cflags='-march=pentium3 -ffast-math' --disable-encoders --disable-strip --disable-network --enable-gpl
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Compiled latest SVN of ffmpeg using this command (excluding cpu specific stuff).

&gt;<i> For DirectFB, I use the following configuration:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ./configure --disable-{unique,multi,fusion,text,mpeg,jpeg,gif,png,freetype,video4linux,video4linux2} --with-inputdrivers=linuxinput --with-gfxdrivers=matrox C{,XX}FLAGS=-march=pentium3
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For softdevice, I use the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ./configure --disable-{vidix,fb,xv,shm,subplugins}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Here I had to manually point the configure script to the directory
where ffmpeg was installed (/usr/local/include.ffmpeg).

&gt;<i> If you have multiple versions of the libraries laying around, you should
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps check the dependencies
</I>&gt;<i> (ldd vdr-1.4.0/PLUGINS/lib/libvdr-softdevice.so.1.4.0).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I decided to clean everything out, just incase I was making school-boy errors.

&gt;<i> &gt; If I set CropMode to 4:3 then the overscan is too severe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess it's a matter of taste.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *If someone knows a definitive answer to this I would be greatful for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the email.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> According to cvs log video-dfb.c, the field-based scaler was introduced
</I>&gt;<i> in revision 1.60 on May 7, 2006.  Last Matrox related changes were in
</I>&gt;<i> the most recent revision (1.68).  The last release (0.2.3) should be
</I>&gt;<i> based on revision 1.58.  So, you will need the CVS version of softdevice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Using CVS softdevice.

&gt;<i> &gt; Hardware is biostar nforce2 based motherboard, underclocked &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; undervolted athlon 2500 barton, 512MB ram, one atapi disk, two kworld
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vstream dvb-t pci cards
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, neither the CPU nor the I/O should be overloaded.  I think you should
</I>&gt;<i> double check that you are running the correct version of DirectFB and
</I>&gt;<i> softdevice.  I don't think that ffmpeg version is that important.  Mine
</I>&gt;<i> is a CVS snapshot from a few months ago.
</I>
Well one thing that has changed is that the only Deinterlace method
available is lavc ( as opposed to before, where I had FB-Intern and a
bunch of others). This may be crazy talk but I had always thought that
FB-Intern was the option I was trying to get to work right. (When I
chose this before I saw the exact same as with 'none', ie interlacing
artifacts on some channels/programmes).

With 'lavc' selected there are no interlacing artifacts, cpu usage
seems to go up 10%, and the current problems I'm having with audio
sync seem to get worse.

With 'none' selected I see interlacing artifacts on certain channels/programmes.

With the screen aspect in softdevice set to 16:9 these artifacts do
not appear, however the aspect ratio is incorrect with vertical
stretching.

As I have video through softdevice working well with deinterlace set
to lavc, I'm tempted to just leave it as it is and concentrate on
pin-pointing the audio sync problems.

However, I'm also keen on getting all the hardware accelerated
features of this card working correctly.

I was looking for a definitive answer to this question:

&quot;Can SoftDevice scale 16:9 interlaced video to a 4:3 TV with Matrox
G450 hardware interlaced output?&quot;

&gt;<i> According to cvs log video-dfb.c, the field-based scaler was introduced
</I>&gt;<i> in revision 1.60 on May 7, 2006.
</I>
You may be answering the question here, but I can't tell for sure.

Thanks for all your help
