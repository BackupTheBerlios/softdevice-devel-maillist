I usually let mine turn itself on and off with nvram-wakeup! I see the problem 
when I leave it for a short while in the middle of something and get 
distracted!

Ooooo...that sounds feasible. I must admit, that I've never sat there for ages 
to see if it wakes up again.

Applied. Not sure I'll be able to recreate the situation off-hand, though.

Hmmm...if you're right about this, how long should it take to overflow? The 
only counter I can see is a 64-bit integer which looks like it's counting in 
useconds which would take a few million years to overflow, by my reckoning! 
Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place and it's a 32-bit counter which would 
take 1 h 12 min to overflow. Not sure it was taking that long but it's hard 
to tell.

I will try to make it happen without the patch and then try with the patched 
version.

Cheers,

Laz
