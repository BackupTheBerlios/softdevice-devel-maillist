</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; The included patch makes dfb:mgatv use YV12 colourspace for video and

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; bad goal-oriented programming, but does what I wanted: improves
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; performance to the level that my 450 MHz P2 can now function as a DVB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; box like no underpowered P2 has done before! Unfortunately, the patch
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; probably breaks everything else, but I'm too lazy to clean it up.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Can you please point out to me what the advantage of using the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; subpicture layer is? To me it looks like the main speed change is that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; you don't scale the osd. Or does the change to YV12 colourspace bring
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; some speed advantage?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Wow - this list has wonky ordering. See my previous mail about this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From you other mail:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I didn't receive the above Martin's message at all - off list, perhaps? 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, if it's still about the topic in question, the keyword for using 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the subpicture layer from my perspective is 'incompetence': I couldn't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get crtc2 (mgatv) video layer working with YV12 colourspace and blitted 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OSD, so, I thought maybe it'd work with a subpicture layer more 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; effortlessly, and it did. So, the advantage for me isn't the OSD really, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but the YV12 for the crtc2 video. YV12-&gt;YUY2 was simply too slow.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, yes I see. I forgot that for mgatv the default is YUY2, I thought
</I>&gt;<i> that it is I420. Of course YV12 is faster compared to YUY2...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why is YUY2 is the default at all? Is the OSD not working at all or is
</I>
Don't ask me.

&gt;<i> &gt; Using YV12 and LUT44 both bring advantages of reduced memory 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requirements and are generally faster. I didn't implement the scaling 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; routines for the LUT44 OSD, because I simply didn't grasp the idea of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the existing code in 5 seconds, and realized that scaling would 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; practically never be required by the tv output.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> Scaling LUT44 makes not much sense, the quality would be very low
</I>&gt;<i> because of the limited colors. The simplest and fastest solution one
</I>
That's true. 2x and (1/2)x scaling might be passable.

&gt;<i> could do, would be to skip or repeat pixels. To adopt the existing
</I>&gt;<i> scaling routines to indexed bitmaps would be dead slow, and probably
</I>&gt;<i> still have a limited quality.
</I>&gt;<i> I saw that you implemented ScaleVUpXXXLut() and ScaleVDownXXXLut(), that
</I>&gt;<i> is not needed, if you don't scale only a CopyToBitmapLut() should be enough.
</I>&gt;<i> But without scaling there probably will be complaints again because of
</I>&gt;<i> the shift of the menu cursor and the menu when using the DVD-plugin.
</I>
What does the DVD plugin do? I haven't tried that one (either). 

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I would not mind adding support for an indexed bitmap, but currently I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; don't see the advantage. If we do that we should probably think again
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; about the interface of GetOSDMode(), I never liked that very much, it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; was a hack from the start...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And I didn't add much style to that either :) Adding the indexed code is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; useless if there are no other users and I'm not going to clean up the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mess I made in video-dfb anytime soon. Of course, if you'd add just the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SoftOsd bits (without maybe the OSD_WIDTH changes), it would make my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; life easier when trying to keep up with cvs updates. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> No, either we apply the DFB part and the OSD part together or nothing. I
</I>
Firm but fair. I'm not going for that, for now, then. Maybe I'll update
the patch sometime and re-post.
