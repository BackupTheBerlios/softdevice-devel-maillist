<PRE>Hello list,

I just built myself a VDR 1.4.2 setup with a budget DVB-C card and
softdevice. I have a Matrox G400 DualHead outputting to a 16:9 CRT TV
using the composite output. Softdevice almost works, but there are some
things I'd like to have working:
- the displayed field order is wrong, which causes annoying flicker -
seems to be deterministically so; restarts won't help
- audio is off-sync quite a bit
- the VDR OSD is for some reason displayed double height - it seems as
if the OSD was drawn on only one of the fields assuming the field is the
whole frame

At the moment, I'm using today's CVS versions of directfb, DFB++, and
softdevice; ffmpeg is SVN from maybe two days ago. I also tried with
ubuntu breezy's included directfb 0.9.22, which gave a better OSD, but
didn't solve the A/V sync or field order issues. The box I'm using is
really weak, a 450MHz P2, but it seems to struggle along with 80-90% CPU
usage according to vmstat. Mplayer can play recorded .ts's on the box
just fine. The kernel is 2.6.12 from ubuntu configured for the P2 and
G400.

The configuration I use is pretty much copy-pasted blindly from the net:
/etc/directfbrc:
mode=720x576
depth = 32
primary-layer=2
pixelformat=ARGB
matrox-crtc2
matrox-tv-standard=pal
matrox-cable-type=composite

relevant bits from VDR's setup.conf:
softdevice.AC3Mode = 0
softdevice.AlsaAC3Device = hw:0,1
softdevice.AlsaDevice = default
softdevice.avOffset = 0
softdevice.bufferMode = 0
softdevice.CropBottomLines = 0
softdevice.CropLeftCols = 0
softdevice.CropMode = 0
softdevice.CropModeToggleKey = 0
softdevice.CropRightCols = 0
softdevice.CropTopLines = 0
softdevice.Deinterlace Method = 0
softdevice.mainMenu = 1
softdevice.OSDalphablend = 0
softdevice.Picture mirroring = 0
softdevice.PixelAspect = 2
softdevice.PixelFormat = 2
softdevice.Postprocess Method = 0
softdevice.Postprocess Quality = 0
softdevice.Suspend = 0
softdevice.syncTimerMode = 0
softdevice.UseStretchBlit = 1
softdevice.vidBrightness = 50
softdevice.vidContrast = 50
softdevice.vidHue = 50
softdevice.vidSaturation = 50
softdevice.Xv-Aspect = 1

Two somewhat unrelated questions I didn't find an answer for are whether
the /etc/fb.modes file has any effect when using TV output and why to
use &quot;--enable-multi&quot; when configuring directfb for VDR use (some people
seemed to use that, so I did, too).

I'd appreciate if anyone can provide some comments/help on these
problems.
