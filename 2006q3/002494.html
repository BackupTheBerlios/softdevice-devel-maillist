No wonder. As I said I probably broke everything else in directfb
output. I left completely stupid hacks in the dfb driver. The patch is
more of a proof-of-concept than anything generally usable. Thanks for
testing, though.

&gt;<i> 2) The OSD colours are wrong much of the time.  For instance, when you
</I>&gt;<i> hit OK while playing a recording, the progress bar will not be updated

I noticed that, too. It's really weird. That one I'm going to fix (or
try), at least. Even letting the menu just hang there messes the colours
after a while eventhough I don't think anything is actually updated by
softdevice. 

&gt;<i> I did not measure CPU consumption, but it might have been slightly lower.
</I>
I get about 20% less CPU usage compared to YUY2, according to vmstat,
when measuring with a &quot;lighter&quot; transmission (544x576) that the CPU
could handle also in YUY2 without too many dropped frames. Because
there's much less blitting going on, there should also be much less
mga_wait_idle:ing going on.
