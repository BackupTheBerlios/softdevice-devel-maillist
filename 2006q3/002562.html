This is probably the reason why I never noticed this... Now I've tried
to pause my vdr for a long time and indeed it looked up :-(

I have now an idea what could be the reason for the deadlock. It could
be that the counters for synchronizing the video are overflowing, the
result would be a _very_ long delay until the next frame is actually
displayed. That would match quite well with Marco's backtrace...

And here is a patch which hopefully fixes the problem (I'm trying
currently it out, which obviously takes some time... but I wanted to
shared it with you in case someone else wants to join the testing)

Bye,
Martin
