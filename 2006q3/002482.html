No, in fact it is waiting for the current operation to finish.  If you
do Flip() immediately after initiating a large blit operation, the CPU
will busy-wait in mga_waitidle() until the operation has finished.

&gt;<i> I believe adding an usleep() is really artificial way of reducing cpu load

It does reduce the CPU load reported by &quot;top&quot; by about 10 per cent,
in my case from around 60% to 50%.

I agree that it is not the right solution and it will probably make things
worse if the CPU is really tightly loaded.  I tried replacing the usleep()
calls with sched_yield(), and that really broke the timing.

I probably did not forward his reply to you, because it was written
in Finnish.  On June 28, he wrote that using an IRQ would help but that
it would require at least one more ioctl() to the kernel.

&gt;<i> Was the modification based on the ioctl calls from him at directfb list

</I>
I haven't tried any kernel patches.
