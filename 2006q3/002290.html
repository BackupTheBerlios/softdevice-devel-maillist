&gt;<i> For the record, I referred to the vdr-subtitles plugin
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.virtanen.org/vdr/subtitles/">http://www.virtanen.org/vdr/subtitles/</A>) that implements the bitmapped
</I>&gt;<i> subtitle layer defined in the DVB standards.  It is implemented on the
</I>&gt;<i> OSD layer, similar to menus.
</I>
Thanks for that link, I now have subtitles working really well.

&gt;<i> Hm, shouldn't &quot;make install&quot; put it to --prefix=/usr/local by default,
</I>&gt;<i> e.g., /usr/local/include, /usr/local/lib, etc.?
</I>
I thought that too,
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well one thing that has changed is that the only Deinterlace method
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available is lavc ( as opposed to before, where I had FB-Intern and a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bunch of others). This may be crazy talk but I had always thought that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; FB-Intern was the option I was trying to get to work right. (When I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chose this before I saw the exact same as with 'none', ie interlacing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; artifacts on some channels/programmes).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aren't you using -vo dfb:mgatv, i.e., TV output?  It should be interlaced,
</I>&gt;<i> and you shouldn't need any deinterlacing.  Deinterlacing is only needed
</I>&gt;<i> on VGA or DVI output, as far as I know.
</I>
Well the question in the first email was whether I should use -vo dfb
or -vo dfb:mgatv! I also mentioned that I was using a home made vga to
scart cable. I do not own the matrox tv out adaptor. I believe that
when I was using CVS DirectFB the interlaced output worked with &quot;-vo
dfb:&quot; although the OSD was halved, enlarged and flickered. Also there
was a copy of the video stream above the 16:9 stream. I will confirm
this soon.

&gt;<i> My vdr box is switched off right now, but are you aware that there are two
</I>&gt;<i> menu items (in different menus) related to this: the screen aspect ratio
</I>&gt;<i> (which I have set to 4:3) and the crop mode (which I usually set to 4:3,
</I>&gt;<i> meaning that the left and right borders are cut off).  When a 16:9 program
</I>&gt;<i> is running, I can change the crop mode (to &quot;none&quot; or &quot;16:9&quot;) without seeing
</I>&gt;<i> any interlacing artefacts.
</I>
I have screen aspect ratio to 4:3 and crop mode to &quot;none&quot; - I can see
the artifacts. The majority of tv in the uk is now broadcast in 16:9,
so I have no need to change crop mode back to 4:3 really. Also,
softdevce seems to manage to scale 4:3 correctly without any cropping!


&gt;<i> If you could make a short 16:9 clip available on some http server and
</I>&gt;<i> tell the URL to me, I can check it on my system and tell if it looks okay.
</I>&gt;<i> The clip should preferrably contain horizontal movement and be interlaced
</I>&gt;<i> in the first place (not a movie).  Maybe there is something unusual in
</I>&gt;<i> the DVB streams you receive, e.g., different field order.
</I>
Here is a clip of the BBC rolling news channel, I can see LOTs of
artifacts with the camera movements, and the scrolling text at the
bottom looks poor:
