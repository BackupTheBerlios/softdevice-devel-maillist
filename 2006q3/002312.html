</I>&gt;<i> this is a mis-coloured OSD, it's pink:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I get an &quot;404 Not Found&quot; with your links. Can you please upload the
pictures again or send updated links?

&gt;<i> As far as I can tell, the OSD goes pink when the resolution of the
</I>&gt;<i> broadcast goes below 640x480. Sometimes, if I leave some part of OSD
</I>&gt;<i> on screen without touching it for a while, it will flick from being
</I>&gt;<i> correct to being pink, and back again, as adverts come and go, at
</I>&gt;<i> different resolutions.  Does anyone have any idea why this might be
</I>&gt;<i> happening? I'd be grateful for any suggestions. (this happens with
</I>&gt;<i> 0.2.3 and a CVS checkout of a few minutes ago).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That makes me think that maybe the there is a bug in the scaling code. I
fixed a bug which had similar consequences a few weeks ago, are you sure
that you recompiled the softdevice correctly when you used the CVS version?
On the other hand there have been  reports from nvidia users who reported
similar problems, maybe it is somehow nvidia related.
I never was able to reproduce these problems ( I don't own an nvidia
card), and it is difficult to debug these problems if I don't see them.
Is the flicking from correct to pink reproducable in a recording? It
would be nice to have a short sequence which shows the problems on your
setup which I could test on my machine.


&gt;<i> Secondly I have an odd problem with windows wrapping:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>That link is also broken...
The funny thing is both femon and osdteletext work nice on my setup.
Which vdr version are you using?

Bye,
Martin
