Then, maybe, I didn't waste my time posting it :)

I read your earlier comment about this on the list. I was curious to ask
if you could elaborate on this a bit. I _very_ briefly looked at what
the Flip call does, and the only wait I saw was the wait for vsync,
which for matroxfb seems to be nicely handled by a waitqueue in the
kernel. Where exactly is the wait you're referring to? I believe adding
an usleep() is really artificial way of reducing cpu load and not really
solving anything - at least when the CPU really is underpowered as in my
case - unless there's some convenient reordering happening in the
scheduling of the vdr threads caused by the added usleep.
