I was originally thinking of using this on my main vdr system which uses viatv 
output but I've since found out that the primary layer supports this but the 
video overlay layer doesn't! I could have adjusted my OSD but not the video! 
Still, I've now had a go on my Matox system.

The actual settings bit seems to work on my Matrox system but it still needs a 
bit of tweaking because I think things have been reordered since the patch 
was written: your patch calls CheckVideoParmChange() before SetParam() is 
called and so videoParmLayer is unset when CheckVideoParmChange() is called 
so it returns straight away.

At the moment, CheckVideoParmChange() is only called from 
GetDisplayFrameTime() at startup and I'm not sure of the best place to add a 
further call: adding it at the end of SetParam() sort of works but it only 
gets called when the aspect ratio, resolution, etc. changes! Ideally, it 
should update the screen as the values are changed in the setup.

Using a combination of playing back recordings at various resolutions (so that 
SetParam() gets called) I can alter the brightness, contrast, etc. for the 
video layer (and OSD layer in this case).

The bug in DFB++ seems to have been fixed (at last, looking back through DFB 
mailing list archives!): I'm using DFB and DirectFB cvs from about April.

Cheers,

Laz
