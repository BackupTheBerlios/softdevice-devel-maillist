</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sure, ranks for all mutexes would help to solve those problems. But I
don't think we actually need them, cVideo is just not complicated enough
;-). We currently have two mutexes in cVideo, I actually don't think
that we need both of them. If we can get rid of one of them, we should
not have any problems with deadlocks.
If some videout driver needs locks to protect calls to actual drivers,
thats not a problem as long as no other methods of cVideo are called
with the lock held.

Bye,
