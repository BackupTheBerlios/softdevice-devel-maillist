This one worked for me.  Test case: pressing the Up or Down key for several
seconds in a short Recordings menu (which fits entirely on the screen)
while playing a recording.  The CPU consumption grew from about 55% to
80%, but very few frames were dropped, and the selection on the OSD menu
was updated smoothly.

I tested this one first.  It removed the fading effect, but unfortunately
it also caused OSD updates to take much longer or to be lost.  When I
pressed the Down button for a second in a short Recordings menu that fits
entirely on screen, the selection jumped around in a bit chaotic way.
I'm just guessing, but could it be a locking granularity issue?
