For the record, I referred to the vdr-subtitles plugin
(<A HREF="http://www.virtanen.org/vdr/subtitles/">http://www.virtanen.org/vdr/subtitles/</A>) that implements the bitmapped
subtitle layer defined in the DVB standards.  It is implemented on the
OSD layer, similar to menus.

Hm, shouldn't &quot;make install&quot; put it to --prefix=/usr/local by default,
e.g., /usr/local/include, /usr/local/lib, etc.?

&gt;<i> Well one thing that has changed is that the only Deinterlace method

Aren't you using -vo dfb:mgatv, i.e., TV output?  It should be interlaced,
and you shouldn't need any deinterlacing.  Deinterlacing is only needed
on VGA or DVI output, as far as I know.

&gt;<i> With the screen aspect in softdevice set to 16:9 these artifacts do
</I>&gt;<i> not appear, however the aspect ratio is incorrect with vertical
</I>&gt;<i> stretching.
</I>
My vdr box is switched off right now, but are you aware that there are two
menu items (in different menus) related to this: the screen aspect ratio
(which I have set to 4:3) and the crop mode (which I usually set to 4:3,
meaning that the left and right borders are cut off).  When a 16:9 program
is running, I can change the crop mode (to &quot;none&quot; or &quot;16:9&quot;) without seeing
any interlacing artefacts.  Both fields are scaled separately, as they
should.  Before video-dfb.c revision 1.60 (the old frame-based scaler),
horizontal movement caused weird waves on the screen.

&gt;<i> I was looking for a definitive answer to this question:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Can SoftDevice scale 16:9 interlaced video to a 4:3 TV with Matrox
</I>&gt;<i> G450 hardware interlaced output?&quot;
</I>
It works for me, and I guess it must also work for Stefan Lucke, who wrote
the field-based scaler.

If you could make a short 16:9 clip available on some http server and
tell the URL to me, I can check it on my system and tell if it looks okay.
The clip should preferrably contain horizontal movement and be interlaced
in the first place (not a movie).  Maybe there is something unusual in
the DVB streams you receive, e.g., different field order.
