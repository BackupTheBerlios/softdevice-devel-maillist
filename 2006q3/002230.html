</I>We had an issue like that long ago, Stefan found out that it was
actually a bug in ffmpeg. How old is your ffmpeg version? I don't
remember exactly which version had this problem, but if your version is
about one year old you could try an update of ffmpeg.

&gt;<i> It usually happens when I stop playback rather than in the 
</I>&gt;<i> middle of something, although I have seen it a couple of times at start up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Please report all crashes of the softdevice! I really don't like the
idea of having crashes with the softdevice. The main problem is that to
be able to do something about it we either have to be able to reproduce
the crash or we must have a (meaningfull) traceback...
But I would really like to try to fix all crashes :-)

Bye,
Martin
