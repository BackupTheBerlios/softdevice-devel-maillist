</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>You are right, vdr recordings don't contain the osd, the idea was that
the resolution of the stream causes the problems. So with streams of the
resolution I might be able to reproduce the problems. But I already
tried to scale the osd to many different resolution and I never got
problems.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>That would really be a great test. What about pci cards? It doesn't
necessarily has to be a Matrox card, any other card would be nice.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Secondly I have an odd problem with windows wrapping:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That link is also broken...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The funny thing is both femon and osdteletext work nice on my setup.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Which vdr version are you using?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> vdr 1.4.0 (binary build in Ubuntu 6.10)
</I>
You are using a prebuild vdr together with a self-compiled softdevice?
Hm, how did you compile the softdevice? Did you make sure that the
prebuild vdr *exactly* matches the sources of vdr you used to build the
softdevice (maybe there are some patches applied) ?
Could you try if you have the same issues if you build both vdr and the
softdevice yourself?

One thing which could help to debug both issues would be if you could
enable the OSDDEB (uncomment the line &quot;#define OSDDEB(out...) in the
file SoftOsd.c and recompile), pipe the output in a file and send it to me.
For the color issue it would be nice to have the same OSD (maybe the
main menu) once when it works fine, and once when it doesn't work.
Actually the nicest would be if you could send the log for the osd when
it flicks from correct to pink or back and try to mark where in the log
where it is fine and where not.
For the issue with osdteletext and femon, you can just send me log, but
please use osdteletext, femon updates the osd quite often, so the log
would be a log larger.

Bye,
Martin
