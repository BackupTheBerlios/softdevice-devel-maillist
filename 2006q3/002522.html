I don't think that for this we actually need a mutex. I saw that you
sent a patch which removes osdMutex from DirectFB. So is this still what
you are thinking? Do we need osdMutex?

&gt;&gt;<i> For Action() of cVideoOut, osdMutex is the wrong one, as the existance

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Introduced a separate mutex for that purpose.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That should fix the hang situation.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Martin, what is areaMutex for ?
</I>
Funny that you are asking me that question, you introduced areaMutex ;-)
Please check video.c revision 1.30 and the corresponding log message.

&gt;&gt;<i> From reading the the code, it is just for serializing calls of YUV() .
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So it could be moved to the private section, right ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Sure, it could be moved. But if you want to do this to avoid deadlocks,
that won't work, since YUV() is still called with areaMutex, or now
oldPictureMutex held. So it is still possible to create deadlocks in the
video-out classes which inherit from cVideo.

&gt;<i> Dropped areaMutex, as there was the possibility of loosing a current
</I>&gt;<i> frame. This is now handled by locking with oldPictureMutex too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Hmm, it would have been simpler just to keep areaMutex and to use
areaMutex instead of osdMutex in cVideo::Action()... Locking an mutex,
which is already held by the thread is not a good coding style (Action()
calls DrawStill())...
And you should update the comments on oldPictureMutex, if it takes over
the responsibilities of areaMutex.

Bye,
Martin
