That is in line with my experience.  Only, instead of pausing, I block
the MPEG stream to softdevice with a small patch to vdr.

Maybe un-pausing triggers an OSD update, and softdevice would only hang
in certain thread schedulings?  My vdr-suspend patch won't pop up any OSD
menu when resuming playback.  When I sent the previous stack traces,
it was the first time I tried to repeat the hang (on the following day
of the original hang).

&gt;<i> Do you see the same behaviour or does it just become responsive without 
</I>&gt;<i> restarting playback?
</I>
It won't respond to SVDRP commands (although the SVDRP service still
answers IIRC) or to button events from the remote control unit.  For
all practical purposes, it is dead until the vdr process is killed
and restarted.  The watchdog timer of vdr will not kick in.

I did not get any further info on today's hang, because the vdr box was
started either by my 3-year-old son or his babysitter. :-)
