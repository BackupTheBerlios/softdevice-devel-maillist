For someone who knows how interrupts are processed in the Linux kernel,
it should not be that hard.  I have programmed interrupt routines in
machine language, but not in C on a sophisticated operating system
like the Linux kernel.  I think that Ville Syrj&#228;l&#228; might have had a
kernel patch for this, but I am not sure how much work it would be
to get it in the 2.6 kernel.

</I>
Oh, you must be using LinuxThreads then.  I've used NPTL for the past year
(just unset the environment variable LD_ASSUME_KERNEL if you are using
GNU libc 2.3 or later).  NTPL should have smaller overhead than LinuxThreads.

&gt;<i> Unpatched:
</I>&gt;<i> -vo dfb:mgatv  = ~40%
</I>&gt;<i> -vo dfb:  = ~21% ( a lovely figure!)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Patched:
</I>&gt;<i> -vo dfb:mgatv = ~29% (great patch)
</I>&gt;<i> -vo dfb: = ~29%
</I>
The usleep() calls should not affect the -vo dfb: code path.  You should
perhaps have watched a recording instead of live stream to get more
repeatable results.  Anyway, you seem to be getting 10% savings on
dfb:mgatv, about the same as me.

&gt;<i> With results like that, and with Matrox hardware scaled interlaced
</I>&gt;<i> output working in 'VGA' mode, I could nearly run vdr on my old AMD K6
</I>&gt;<i> 500mhz relic.
</I>
You need some margin.  I was unable to underclock my system, but I think
you will be dropping frames if the CPU load goes above 60% or 70%.

&gt;<i> &gt; I plan to make some OProfile measurements this weekend.  At the very least,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will measure the impact of colour space transformation (i.e., let
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -vo dfb:mgatv show wrong colours by pretending it uses the native output
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; colour space of ffmpeg).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I remember you saying your cable didn't work with &quot;-vo dfb:&quot; because
</I>&gt;<i> that option didn't generate a composite sync signal - well I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think I made it clear enough that I _did_ see a picture of comparable
</I>&gt;<i> (slightly sharper) quality using &quot;-vo dfb:&quot; &amp; the cable from the
</I>&gt;<i> diagram we both used.
</I>
And come to think of it, it might be that the problem is not the
colour space conversion but simply the Flip() call.  I seem to remember
that Stefan's test program from June or so gave comparable results
for memcpy() and yv12_to_yuy2_il_mmx2().  The only thing that you could
avoid on -vo dfb: output is the memcpy(), i.e., let ffmpeg uncompress
the data directly to the frame buffer (if it does not do so already).

&gt;<i> Basically, latest DirectFB CVS with softdevice option '-vo dfb:' seems
</I>&gt;<i> to generate a composite signal just like '-vo dfb:mgatv' does.
</I>
I'll give it another try in that case.
