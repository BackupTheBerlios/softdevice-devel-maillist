Got it thanks, but I could not see artifacts and scrolling text looks
fine on my 4:3 TV (use directfb cvs from today with OSD issues).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are there any news on the DirectFB front?  I would appreciate an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interrupt-driven interface, to avoid burning CPU in the Flip() method.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Besides, the code from DirectFB CVS for better interlaced output broke
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the OSD.  Has the situation improved since I last checked (June perhaps)?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to investigate the output using &quot;softdevice -vo dfb:&quot; as I
</I>&gt;<i> seem to rememebr that although the OSD was broken and there was a
</I>&gt;<i> mirroring of picture above and below the 'letter box' there were no
</I>&gt;<i> artifacts, and there was also an option to use the Fb-Intern(al)
</I>&gt;<i> de-interlacer. Does that have anything to do with the matrox's
</I>&gt;<i> Interlaced output(?).
</I>
The OSD is broken with DirectFB since field blit has been added to DirectFB-cvs.
I know this is very annoying. Currently I'm looking for that.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some sort of reply from the softdevice programmers or any one from
