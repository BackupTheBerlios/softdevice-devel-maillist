After skimming through the discussion I was under the impression that
the software versions I used should have worked, hence my post.

I updated to today's (14.9.) CVS and, indeed, the OSD works now. The
field order issue, however, largely remains. One station that broadcasts
in 352x576 works, but others (704/720) don't. The 352x576 station uses
around 50% CPU and the full D1 broadcasts vary between 60-85% approx. It
doesn't seem like frames are dropped, but could the higher cpu usage
cause timing problems and thus the field order issue? Is there any way
to make softdevice use deeper decode (target) buffering? Btw. I tried
changing the fieldParity variable in video-dfb.c to 1, but it didn't
have any effect.
