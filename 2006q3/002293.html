I mean a composite sync signal with 15625 Hz line rate (horizontal sync)
and 50 Hz field rate (vertical sync) and 25 Hz frame rate (interlaced output).
My monitor is a Commodore 1084 a.k.a. Philips CM8833.  It is a PAL and RGB
monitor from the era of the Commodore Amiga 500.  Its SCART connector is
somewhat non-standard.  On separate connectors, it also supports an S-video
like interface as well as separate hsync and vsync.  However, on the SCART
it only supports composite sync, as far as I know.

I once tried to get composite video output from my vdr box (to record
something to a VHS video cassette recorder) but failed, even after tweaking
the cable.  The VCR would ignore the RGB signals and only record black video
from the composite sync signal.  Some TVs require a voltage to be applied
to some SCART connector pin in order to activate RGB input.  Otherwise, you'd
only see black screen.

&gt;<i> I would like to know the differences between '-vo dfb' and '-vo
</I>&gt;<i> dfb:mgatv'. I wonder who is the expert and whether they feel up to
</I>&gt;<i> explaining it somewhere....
</I>
AFAIK, for -vo dfb:mgatv, you will have to use the second head.  The first
head is useable for a VGA monitor (Linux console) while the second head
outputs video.

For -vo dfb, I believe that no composite sync signal is generated.  It should
be like VGA video (separate hsync and vsync signals).  Thus, you can't use
it for SCART input without building a composite sync generator, unless I'm
mistaken.  In theory, you can use either head, but I didn't try with two
VGA monitors.  For some time, I used a VGA monitor at 75 kHz, sometimes
without a deinterlacer.

&gt;<i> My cable is built using the same circuit!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd be interested in your cable schematics, if you managed to get a picture
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from SCART.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Have you not got a picture using the circuit above?!
</I>
I meant from -vo dfb.  The cable only works for -vo dfb:mgatv.

&gt;<i> I had this with my Radeon 9200SE but couldn't get a good enough
</I>&gt;<i> picture. Was VERY difficult to tweak the settings as there is no real
</I>&gt;<i> time update like with PowerStrip on XP.
</I>
Back when I had an old 75 kHz/70 Hz fixed-sync monitor in active use,
I used xvidtune to fine-tune the settings under XFree86.  AFAIR, one
could tune anything except the dotclock and the active resolution in
real time.  I think that the X.org and DirectFB mode lines are equivalent,
maybe with a slightly different format.

&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks, I downloaded it and will have a look later, hopefully tonight.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Horizontally scrolling text is excellent for this purpose.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You should see the artifacts easily enough with the main picture!
</I>
I can confirm the artifacts when using any vertically scaled output.
Only the 4:3 crop mode (with the sides cut out) looks fine.
