Added some comment on what osdMutex is protecting.
For Action() of cVideoOut, osdMutex is the wrong one, as the existance
and current contend of previous decoded frame has to be protected.
Introduced a separate mutex for that purpose.

That should fix the hang situation.

Martin, what is areaMutex for ?
From reading the the code, it is just for serializing calls of YUV() .
So it could be moved to the private section, right ?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; FWIW, a good design principle would be to avoid deadlocks by avoiding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cycles in the waits-for graph altogether.  This can be achieved by having
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all threads acquire mutexes in the same order (and to release them in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opposite order in a stack-like fashion).  Assign a rank to each mutex,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and make sure that each thread can acquire only mutexes of lower rank
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than those it is currently holding.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, ranks for all mutexes would help to solve those problems. But I
</I>&gt;<i> don't think we actually need them, cVideo is just not complicated enough
</I>&gt;<i> ;-). We currently have two mutexes in cVideo, I actually don't think
</I>&gt;<i> that we need both of them. If we can get rid of one of them, we should
</I>&gt;<i> not have any problems with deadlocks.
</I>&gt;<i> If some videout driver needs locks to protect calls to actual drivers,
