Subject: [Softdevice-devel] Softieee1394
Message-ID: <276699.83904.qm@web23404.mail.ird.yahoo.com>


Hi all,
i'm trying to compile softieee1394 on suse 11.0 (gcc 4.3.1) and with ffmpeg 0.5.0, libavc1394 0.5.3, libraw1394 1.3.0.
It compile without any error, but when i use the plugin with vdr i get this error:

vdr: ./PLUGINS/lib/libvdr-softieee1394.so.1.6.0: undefined symbol: _Z13av_read_frameP15AVFormatContextP8AVPacket

I checked the source code and added the complete path to the include, but without any result.
Can anyone help me solving this problem ?
Thanks,
 Arturo

I use this combo with Hauppauge HVR4000 (Lite) card that allegedly supports DVB-S2. For whatever reason it only tunes in to limited number of DVB-S2 channels, but even on these I get no picture. There are no error messages in logs when tuning to HD channels. Is softdevice known to work for HDTV?

 

I also tried xineliboutput plugin but it?s hopelessly broken on 1.7.4. 

 

My screen resolution is 1024x768 ? could that be an issue? It?s probably not enough for full HD picture but shouldn?t it just get scaled down? I have libswscale support enabled.

Hi Peter,
 
as far as i know, there is no support for vdr-1.7.4 in softdevice.
Stefan said that he would look at this issue once he has time
enough, but so far the only way for a working vdr-1.7.4 is to use
vdr-xine.

Hmm, CVS softdevice compiles cleanly and works fine under VDR 1.7.4. The only problem I?m (not) seeing is HDTV, but I?m not even sure it?s softdevice?s fault.

 

I checked vdr-xine and looks like it does not do direct output to X. I have to use a frontend ? don?t want that hassle unless I can get away with a simple X.

Since the middle of 2008 softdevice has the ability 
to suspend the output. For example when power 
button is pressend and vdr stay on because a 
recording is running.
Maybe this feature should be configurable on the 
softdevice setup page.

Thanks for great work.

Summary: ShmClient Fullscreen

Details: Hello,
I would like to start ShmClient in full screen mode, but it does not work.
I used -vo shm:full in the server options, and xinit -e ShmClient -f to start the client but I get on my screen (1920x1080) just a small window.
Softdevice is compiled from cvs, but also compiling 0.5.0 gives me the same problem. VDR is 1.7.5.
Hope in a help!

 passthrough mode no longer working
Message-ID: <4A23CF30.4000503@users.sourceforge.net>

Hi there,

well, I haven't used softdevice anymore for a long time, because I had some
strange video issues (only black screen with OSD, no video), and after I
decided to start with a fresh new system on my VDR machine, now I'm giving
vdr-1.7.7 a try, with the plugins that work already with it, softdevice
being one of them.
I tried this with softdevice-0.5.0.20090218 (as packaged in gentoo) and
CVS,
and my problem is that my external amplifier hooked up via optical SPDIF
detects no signal when switching to AC3 audio tracks of channels or
recordings. This works however when playing a video file with an AC3 track
in fbxine for example. I mostly copied over the settings from my old
system,
where even this ac3 passtrhrough with softdevice used to work. Here are
some
settings and outputs that might be relevant:


In /etc/vdr/setup.conf, I have:
CurrentDolby = 1
DolbyTransferFix = 0  # don't know what this does, there is no difference
UseDolbyDigital = 1
UseDolbyInRecordings = 1
softdevice.AC3Mode = 1 # should be passthrough, right?


'aplay -l' shows:

And the most important, the parameters given to the softdevice plugin:

I have to mention that normal mpeg audio is decoded and sent as PCM to the
SPDIF, only AC3 and only with vdr softdevice is the problem. I tried hw:0,0
and hw:0,1 as well, but no sound. How to deal with this, did I miss
something?

So card 0 and device 2 should be ok. But the line with subdevice #0  
irritates me.

Are there messages written to stderr which start with "ac3play"  
(autsch: everything written to stdout grr) ?

Well, if that's what the "null" device does... However, I do not use it (at 
least, not knowingly).

No, unfortunately none of those "ac3play" messages are written, really 
strange...

So I misread that one. Thought that there was a break inserted by  
someone, and the line should read: "IEC958 (S/PDIF) Digital Audio  
Output null".

So everything looks ok, but there is no sound :-( .
There are 2 additional code paths (4 choices in total):

1. Switching to professional transmission:
    setting 'ac3SpdifPro = true' in audio-alsa.c, line 41.
2. Different open for AC3 with patch from Roland Praml found here:
    http://www.vdr-portal.de/board/thread.php?postid=506499#post506499
    Patch includes enforcing of spdifpro mode.

If you need help, please ask again.
