Hello Leo,

I have VIA M10000 and was experimenting the same problems. Fortunately I 
found a &quot;solution&quot;, but I don't know what is causing the problem. Maybe you 
have the same scenario.

Hardware + Linux Kernel + basic software:
- VIA M10000 CLE266  (Nehemiah)
- Linux 2.6.18.1 kernel (Puppy linux distro)
- Twinhan USB2 Alpha DVB-T dongle (uses dvb-usb-vp7045 firmware file)
- VDR version 1.4.3-2 (patch level 2)
- Softdevice plugin in VDR  (CVS version)
- DirectFB + DFB  (CVS versions)
- FFMPEG (SVN version)
- linux-viafb framebuffer driver (CVS version)
- libclempegdec-0.5 (downloaded from sourceforge)

VDR is started using vdr -P&quot;softdevice -vo dfb:cle266:viatv&quot; option (and 
other plugins having nothing to do with this problem).

I had this combination working just fine somewhere in last November. Nice 
picture in CRT-Television using VIAFB tv output and processor load was about 
30%. Therefore hw accelerated mpeg must have been working. Softdevice, 
DirectFB/DFB, FFMPEG and linux-viafb were all CVS/SVN checkout versions from 
November.

Note! The version I had was still working with /ETC/DIRECTFBRC 
pixelformat=ARGB setting so directfb was that old.

In February I decided to upgrade every CVS/SVN version because based on 
changelogs there seemed to be lots of fixes and improvements.

Uuuh. Then problems started. After updating ffmpeg to latest SVN version and 
DirectFB/DFB/softdevice/linux-viafb to latest CVS versions in February, VDR 
and mpeg output stopped working. Lots of decoder had errors messages or 
sometimes the picture was completely black but curiously epg, audio and DVB 
subtitles worked.

I was smart enough to delete old sources before I updated everything so I 
could not verify whether the old sources would have still work :-)

Well, when I checked out old versions from everything from CVS/SVN (back to 
November version) things worked again. Then I started to update CVS/SVN 
versions one by one to see which one breaks the system. It turned out to be 
the latest FFMPEG version from SVN repository.

Now-a-days I finally have working system with following software versions:
- Softdevice plugin in VDR  (latest CVS version from 
cvs.softdevice.berlios.de)
- DirectFB + DFB  (latest CVS versions from DirectFB.org. This version uses 
pixelformat=AiRGB)
- linux-viafb framebuffer driver (latest CVS version from DirectFB.org)
- libclempegdec-0.5 (downloaded from sourceforge)
- FFMPEG (SVN using 2006-12-01 date from svn.mplayerhq.hu)

If I try to use the latest SVN version of FFMPEG, the picture breaks just 
like Leo described (errors or nothing but black picture) but the old 
2006-12-01 version works.

I used following command to checkout older revision of FFMPEG:
cd /usr/src/
svn checkout -r {20061201} <A HREF="svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/ffmpeg/trunk">svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/ffmpeg/trunk</A> ffmpeg

This could be problem in FFMPEG itself so not really softdevice plugin 
problem. Or the latest FFMPEG would require a bit different softdevice 
plugin interface. I have no idea.

I hope this helps to track down the problem. Or whether me and Leo are the 
only ones having problems with the latest SVN FFMPEG version?

Best regards,
Mike
