<PRE>Mark Adams a &#233;crit :
&gt;&gt;<i> Result is :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       1 current frame + 0 field 0 flipping on field 0
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       1 current frame + 2 field 0 flipping on field 0
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       1 current frame + 40 field 0 flipping on field 0
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       1 current frame + 1 field 0 flipping on field 0
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       2 current frame + 1 field 1 flipping on field 0
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      12 current frame + 1 field 0 flipping on field 0
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       2 current frame + 1 field 1 flipping on field 0
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       1 current frame + 2 field 0 flipping on field 0
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       2 current frame + 1 field 0 flipping on field 0
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ... etc...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK then, it appears that you're simply not able to generate frames fast
</I>&gt;<i> enough, with the effect that frames will be repeated.  If that happens and
</I>&gt;<i> the frames are interlaced, you will see nasty judder because you get to see
</I>&gt;<i> something like field 1, field 2, field 3, field 4, field 3, field 4, field
</I>&gt;<i> 7, field 8 etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wherever you see '+2' in the output, that means that more than 1 frame
</I>&gt;<i> period has elapsed since the last frame was flipped.
</I>
If I understand correctly, &quot;+1&quot; means that there was no dropped frames,
whether the flip occured during field 0 or 1. Field 1 meaning that
decoding was a bit late, but not enough to show stutter on screen...

&gt;<i> You can see that often the flips occur first during field 0 of a frame,
</I>&gt;<i> then
</I>&gt;<i> after a few frames, they've slipped into field 1, then you skip a frame and
</I>&gt;<i> go back to field 0.
</I>
That's softdevice behaviour, which tries to keep up with frame rate. OK.

&gt;<i> I suspect that the DirectFB gfxdriver and the framebuffer are working
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly but your hardware is just not able to keep up with generating
</I>&gt;<i> frames.
</I>
This is a Via C3 Nehemiah 1GHz, with the following CPU usage on typical
live TV :

* software decoding:
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
 2820 vdr       15   0  264m  54m 5696 S 58.0 24.7   0:42.09 vdr
* hardware decoding:
 3118 vdr       15   0  278m  50m 5580 S 37.7 23.2   0:17.70 vdr

General CPU usage (HW decoding):
Cpu(s): 20.0% us,  9.3% sy,  0.0% ni, 66.3% id,  0.0% wa,  4.3% hi,  0.0% si

Maybe the problem is the load average, which seems to reach 1.00 (after
a few minutes):
	load average: 1.07, 1.02, 0.50
(this may be biased by logging and &quot;top&quot;, ssh, etc.)

That's on the softdevice side it seems.
Laz's 1.2GHz may be just the missing bit to get full synch...

&gt;<i>    307 current frame + 1 field 0 flipping on field 0
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    792 current frame + 1 field 0 flipping on field 0
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Those bits probably displayed properly, yes?
</I>
I guess... Since output is directed to a buffered file, I can't say for
sure.

&gt;<i> I presume that output you quoted was for the software decode case?  How
</I>&gt;<i> does it look when you use the hardware decoder?
</I>
This was the hardware decoder. The following set is with software decoding :

      1 current frame + 0 field 0 flipping on field 0
      1 current frame + 2 field 0 flipping on field 0
      1 current frame + 26 field 1 flipping on field 0

      1 current frame + 1 field 1 flipping on field 0
   1584 current frame + 1 field 0 flipping on field 0

This case has no +2, except at the beginning. After that, the output is
smooth.

@Stefan : is upgrading softdevice from 0.3.1 to CVS a good idea to try
to improve this (I know, the answer is not &quot;no&quot;) ?
