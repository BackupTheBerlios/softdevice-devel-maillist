I checked out a fresh CVS yesterday and changed the 'if (0)' to 'if (1)' 
at line 546 in video.c. The result was that I've now got A/V sync 
problems lasting much shorter in time than before. It seems to fix 
itself also because I didn't have to do anything to get the A/V in sync 
again. I'm not quite sure but I think that the problems sometimes occur 
at the same time that the HD led is active. I've switched off all the 
unneeded services and VDR is the only 'user activity' on the machine.

Tried to find some more debugging options in softdevice but didn't do 
any changes. How do I set softdevice to send a little bit more debugging 
info?
