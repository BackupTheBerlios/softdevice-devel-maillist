I've also patched softdevice with a patch that should have solved 
another issue for me. ( Unfortunately it didn't ) It was the patch 
released on the list here:

<A HREF="http://www.linuxtv.org/pipermail/vdr/2007-March/012476.html">http://www.linuxtv.org/pipermail/vdr/2007-March/012476.html</A>

Have noticed an unwanted A/V-sync issue with my current setup. I've 
recently switched to faster/better hardware ( Core 2, 1.86GHz ). The 
problem I've got is that when watching live TV I've getting this nasty 
A/V sync problem. Sometimes it fixes itself (!) and also sometimes it 
will get in sync after I switch channel. IIRC I didn't have this problem 
running the installation with my old hardware. The difference is that 
I'm running a kernel compiled with coretemp patch and with another 
processor selected.

I have one DVB-S and one DVB-T, ( both budget cards ) and I've got the 
same problem on either card, so I don't think it has anything to do with 
a weak signal (?).

I've got a feeling that it has something to do with backgrounding tasks 
as I see temp raises from ~46 to ~54 degrees Celsius when it starts to 
loose sync. I've also noticed that idle drops from about 96 to 87 when 
the problem occurs. Maybe it's the patch mentioned earlier in this 
message? I'll try with a fresh install later today to sort things out.

Anyone with this problem?

Sincerely,
Per
