</I>I just commited a few changes to the A-V sync. One change may be 
interesting for the SPDIF out off-sync problem: now video and audio wait 
for each other before starting. Before each of the stream was played as 
soon as data was available and syncing was done while playing. Now the 
syncronization between audio and video should be much better at the 
start, maybe this improves the situation for SPDIF out...

I have some more things which I like to now... Is it possible with your 
soundcard to have SPDIF out and analog out at one time? Is analog out 
and SPDIF out asynchron?
There is a menu entry A/V Delay in the softdevice menu, is it possible 
to syncronize SPDIF out and the video with this option? If you need a 
bigger range you can multiply setupStore.avOffset by ten in 
mpeg2decoder.c method cAudioStreamDecoder::GetPTS().
If you have a synchronized A/V stream for one station, what happens if 
you switch away and back again? Is the synchronisation still okay?
Can you please tell me offsets for some stations which correct the A/V 
syncronisations?

Bye,
Martin
