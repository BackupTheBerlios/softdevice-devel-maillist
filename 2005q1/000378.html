</I>The softdevice tries to use the RTC for the A/V sync, I always wanted to 
add some option to disable this, but I never did. You can disable this 
by commenting all the lines in mpeg2decoder.c line 411 to 429 ( where it 
opens /dev/rtc and does the ioctl calls) and add a line like rtc_fd=-1;. 
The softdevice will then fallback to usleep() timing.
Or wait until I managed to add an option to disable the RTC timing, I 
hope that I manage soon.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any simple and reliable way to control the softdevice playback mode
</I>&gt;<i> from vdr.c?
</I>As far as I now not. But maybe you can the softdevice's setupStore, then 
it would be possible..

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, I'd like to start with playback suspended when doing an
</I>&gt;<i> unattended timed recording.  In that way, corrupt DVB packets are less likely
</I>&gt;<i> to crash or hang VDR during recording.  I've heard that full-featured cards
</I>&gt;<i> may lock up when fed garbage, and I have experienced one repeatable softdevice
</I>&gt;<i> crash myself.
</I>Actualy  on the start of vdr the softdevice should start in the same 
playback mode it was when the vdr was stopped, provided it saved the 
setupSore, but I never tried that.
What about this repeatable softdevice crash, was it due to bad signal 
quality, or something different? If you know how to reproducible crash 
the softdevice, then please tell us how, so that we can fix it.

Bye,
Martin
