I'll check that information when my VDR box is up and running again and
I have the time.  I guess I'll have to start VDR via an OpenSSH connection,
because I haven't figured out how to reliably switch virtual consoles while
vdr-softdevice is running on DirectFB.  (I also didn't figure out how to
run it without suid root.  The console-switching ioctl()s may need superuser
privileges.)

I renamed remote.conf altogether.  Hmm, it certainly gets the keypresses,
and it sometimes recognizes that a key is being pressed.  I believe that
in all cases, it had something to do with the Left Alt, Shift or Ctrl key;
printable characters didn't seem to work at all.

On this system, I'm using softdevice-0.1.0pre1 and vdr-1.3.22.  I'm using
this kind of debugging statement in video-xv.c:

        len = XLookupString (&amp;event. xkey, buffer, 80, &amp;keysym, &amp;compose);
fprintf(stderr,&quot;XV-Lookup: l = %d k = 0x%08x, %p\n&quot;, len, keysym, xvRemote);
        switch (keysym)

Here's the result (compiled with &quot;make NO_KBD=1&quot; and
&quot;make plugins {C,CXX}FLAGS=-g&quot;)

XV-Lookup: l = 1 k = 0x00000031, 0x81c8e18

(I picked the number keys 4, 2 and 1, because there didn't seem to be
any special meaning attached to them.)  I also tried running it inside
gdb.  Here's the stack trace from the 'default' case:

#0  cRemote::Put (this=0x0, Code=0, Repeat=183, Release=false) at remote.c:120
#1  0xb741338f in cXvRemote::PutKey (this=0x81c8ef8, key=51) at video-xv.c:242
#2  0xb741404a in cXvVideoOut::ProcessEvents (this=0x81bd890) at video-xv.c:515
#3  0xb74133ff in cXvRemote::Action (this=0x81c8ef8) at video-xv.c:256
#4  0x080e39a6 in cThread::StartThread (Thread=0x81c8f08) at thread.c:227
#5  0xb7f72e51 in pthread_start_thread () from /lib/libpthread.so.0
#6  0xb7f72ecf in pthread_start_thread_event () from /lib/libpthread.so.0
#7  0xb7e296ea in clone () from /lib/libc.so.6

Somehow, the keycode seems to be lost when cXvRemote::PutKey() calls
cRemote::Put().  But it most probably is just gdb acting up; I didn't
look at the machine instructions to see how the parameters are being
passed.

Could I be seeing the same bug on DirectFB?  Both systems are probably
running g++ (GCC) 3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5-12).  Is it maybe something
nasty with the default function arguments in C++?  Nope, I tried removing
the defaults from that cRemote::Put method, but it didn't change anything.

It seems that this bug only affects the learning of the keys.  Once
vdr detects a keypress (on my last successful test, it took maybe 5 or 10
seconds after I had stopped pressing keys), it will register all keypresses
correctly.  Also, subsequent vdr runs will reliably react on the learned keys
without any noticeable delay.
