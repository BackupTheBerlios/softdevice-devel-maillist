&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (a) A/V sync is a bit of a problem. It's probably mostly my fault for

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; resampling. I'm willing to do most of the work on this myself, but I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; think I might need lots of help from you, explaining the stages the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sound goes through as it's decoded and buffered etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is that sync issue common between all channels or for a specific one ?
</I>
I haven't had time to sit and watch anything long enough to really tell
the extent, but it seems all channels can go out of sync a little bit.
One time on BBC 1 it got really bad. I heard a few vague things
suggesting BBC may have issues that other channels don't.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (b) Sometimes when starting VDR after using MPlayer I get the blank
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; white screen problem again and I can't make it work properly until I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; reboot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> mplayer problem !?
</I>
MPlayer works OK, and IIRC it can be restarted and work normally after
VDR has failed in this way. Those are the only two working DFP apps I
have currently. If it's beyond softdevice's control, I would have
thought it's more likely to be DirectFB's fault than MPlayer's.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (c) I can't use VDR's mplayer plugin for two reasons. One is that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; softdevice appears to be leaving the sound card tied up, so mplayer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; can't play sound. The other is that when returning to VDR it either
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; plays a couple of seconds of sound with a black screen, then locks up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; with lots of ringbuffer errors in the log, or produces a garbled screen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; in garish colours with only room for about half the OSD. When I used to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; use th DXR3 plugin, starting the mplayer plugin would pop up a message
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; about releasing DXR3 devices, so I guess something similar is needed for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; softdevice to make it fully shut down and reinitialise.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So dfb-out should resume reconnect (as xv-out does) dfb, someone else
</I>&gt;<i> asked for that too. The only problem I see with such a feature is that I see
</I>&gt;<i> no way at the moment to reconnect, as in such a situation I have to release
</I>&gt;<i> everything I allocated of dfb.
</I>
Can't you release it all before mplayer.sh starts, then reallocate it
afterwards?
