</I>
vdr-xine no. The reason for me to step into softdevice was that I was not
forced to patch other applications and libs.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> I personally like to transcode videos while I do recordings ( my pc is

</I>
But don't do a logoff as your vdr standalone would be killed, your
vdr-server wouldn't.

&gt;<i> Or just imagine someone who wants to listen to mp3 with his favourite 
</I>&gt;<i> mp3-player while doing a recording...
</I>
Ok there is demand for such a feature and some arguments for it so let's
include it. I just wanted to know for what it is used.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So like Stefan suggested I will create a menu entry for suspending the 
</I>&gt;<i> video. Since I like to have a hotkey for suspending I will leave that 
</I>&gt;<i> option too, but make it configurable from the Makefile. Are there some 
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions which key should be used? I originally wanted to use 's' but 
</I>&gt;<i>   that's already taken for 'Saturation'...
</I>
We should make most of them OSD accessible as other output modes may have
them too. The remaining should be
'f' toggle fullscreen,
'r' toggle release/resume output mode 

&gt;<i> Are there some other objections against including this feature in the 
</I>&gt;<i> softdevice?
</I>
No.
