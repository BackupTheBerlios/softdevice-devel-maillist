</I>I don't agree on this point. I can only watch TV in fb-out mode with a 
resolution of 640x480. If the OSD is not scaled I see only a part of the 
OSD. The same for Xv-out when useing a smaller window. I don't think 
that unscaled OSD makes sense here.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>These suggestions sound reasonable.
As I already said I agree that the OSD is a mess, and it certainly 
deserves a cleanup. In my opinion we should use the same code for all 
video out methods where it is possible and have as few differences as 
possible. But that's not only the OSD drawing which could be done 
cleaner. For instance the copying from the picture buffer to the 
graphics card memory is done different in all video out methods, but 
it's essentially the same thing. Also the conversion to YUV2, there is 
the exact same code in vidix-out and dfb-out, why not have one routine 
which does the copying and, if necessary, the format conversion?

For the OSD, what I would like to do is to replace the vdr's cBitmap 
with our own. Then we could draw the OSD in the right pixel format, and 
all the format conversions in Draw() won't be necessary and scaling 
could be done a lot faster, because we won't have to lookup all the 
indices...
At a first glance it may be enough to overload cBitmap::SetIndex(), 
unfortunaly it is not a virtual method. We could give it a try and if it 
works ask Klaus Schmidiger to make SetIndex virtual.

Bye,
Martin
