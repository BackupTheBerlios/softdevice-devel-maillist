<PRE>Hi all,

I finished a small patch which adds support of raw PCM audio codec to 
the softdevice. The way I implemented this is not the cleanest way, but 
the easiest way: The raw audio stream is sent to the AudioStreamDecoder, 
and I added a small class which parses the PCM header and extracts the 
audio data.
The way I would prefer to do it, would be to switch the whole parsing of 
the PES stream to libavformat (which is provided by ffmpeg), and use the 
AVPacket to send the audio and video streams to the appropriate decoder. 
This way we would be prepared to handle all the codecs libavcodec can 
handle (including mp2, raw PCM, ac3 and many others and maybe other 
video codecs as well?? We could easily replay .avi files with vdr, we 
would just need an additional cPlayer...). We could also get rid of the 
double parsing of the PES headers in the mpeg decoder, and have instead 
the well tested ffmpeg parser. But that would mean to almost completly 
rewrite mpegdecoder.c. I hope to find the time to do this in a not too 
far future...
Anyway, for now I would like to ask you to try out this patch, and if 
there are no complaints or objections I will commit this patch in a few 
days.

Bye,
Martin
Martin
