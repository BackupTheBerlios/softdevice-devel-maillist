I wanted to let you know, I checked for these off-sync problems when 
using vdr-xine viewed in df_xine, and there are no delays, everything is 
in sync on channels with various bitrates on MP2, even on Sat1/Pro7 with 
AC3. But xine has the &quot;mono MP2&quot; and the field parity issues softdevice 
had before the latest changes, too (of course, using the same Matrox 
G400 TV-out in DirectFB), and also switches channels slower than softdevice.
