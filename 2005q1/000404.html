Hi Stefan,

thank you for the debug patch. I've seen no filed order changes output 
in my log file. But after Jari H said it could be the command line he 
saw that I posted earlier today, well, yesterday, it's midnight now, I 
checked that damned line again, and I've got interesting news!
I only compiled softdevice with the DFB subplugin, but now I remember it 
once only had generic DFB support, and then the specialized mgatv was 
introduced by you. It happens that I invoked it almost all the time 
wrong (I didn't try it often, my vdr runs mainly in deamon mode for 
scheduled recordings from which I archive to DVDs right now, as I 
thought it wasn't enough WAF-ready to replace my cheap Aldi-receiver 
from last summer). Namely, I invoked it like
vdr ..... -P'softdevice -L /usr/lib/vdr -vo:mgatv'
which I think makes softdevice run on the &quot;generic&quot; directfb code path, 
as mgatv is probably ignored when invoked that way.
Then, after reading Jari's message (thanks a lot!), I invoked it as it 
is supposed to be invoked for Matrox TV-out:
vdr ..... -P'softdevice -L /usr/lib/vdr -vo dfb:mgatv'

So the difference between theese 2 invokationa are that the first one 
gives me judder but synced audio, and the second one, tailored for 
Matrox G4xx TV-out gives me almost perfect video (no more field parity 
issues, just a little jump once in a while, maybe smoe sync-related 
catch-up), but the audio is off-sync again.

I didn't notice the first invocation was wrong, there was no error 
message, but the normal directfb output was chosen (maybe also because 
there is no other subplugin compiled in my case).

Maybe you're now able to find out what makes the non-mgatv code path in 
softdevice succeed in AV-sync and the mgatv path fail. Well, what about 
you, is AV in sync when using -vo dfb:mgatv (and not -vo:mgatv like I did)?

Lucian
