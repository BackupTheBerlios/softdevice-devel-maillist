Thanks for the advice!  After I forced LinuxThreads instead of NPTL, it
worked.  Also the whole played back okay after the clipping.

I really regret that I didn't preserve the corrupted clip that crashed
an earlier version of VDR and the softdevice plugin.  If I remember
correctly, it displayed some error messages or assertion failure about
audio.

By the way, when I first set up VDR, I used an em8300/ADV7175AKS card and the
dxr3 plugin.  There, I had to remove an assertion about malformed audio too,
in order to edit a clip (a different one).  With the dxr3 plugin, playback
is somehow delayed by a couple of seconds, and fine-tuning edit marks doesn't
give any visual feedback until playback is resumed.  I became a softdevice
user, because the card died and replacing the only chip with visible damage
didn't help.

To bring this back on topic: It seems that softdevice-plugin ignores the
softdevice.Suspend = 1 setting in setup.conf at startup, and always starts
with playback enabled.
