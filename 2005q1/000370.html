You are probably right.  I tested it with NPTL as well (after disabling
the nagging about LD_ASSUME_KERNEL in VDR), without success.

I added some debugging output to remote.c:

bool cRemote::Put(const char *Code, bool Repeat, bool Release)
{
  if (learning &amp;&amp; this != learning)
     return false;
  eKeys Key = Keys.Get(Name(), Code);
fprintf(stderr, &quot;Put %x '%s' %p %s\n&quot;, (unsigned) Key, Code, learning, unknownCode);

I also added a debug fprintf to video-dfb.c.  The '%s' in the above format
string matches that output.

On the first keypress, unknownCode was NULL.  It wasn't cleared between
successive keypresses.  Every time, Key was kNone and learning was pointing
to the same location.

I tried to manually write a key mapping to remote.conf.  That worked.  So,
the bug is in the vdr learning mode and not in the softdevice plugin.

Sometimes, vdr bypassed the learning mode, even though remote.conf
didn't exist.  Sometimes, the screen remains blank and vdr consumes
about 1 % of available processing power (Intel Celeron running at 900 MHz).
Has anyone tried to run vdr under Valgrind's helgrind tool?

I also noticed that the codes returned by vdr-softdevice-plugin's
video-dfb.c differ from those returned by vdr-remote-plugin.
Does DirectFB do some mapping on its own?  What if new codes are
introduced in &lt;linux/input.h&gt;? Does DirectFB need to be recompiled,
or does DirectFB merely add some prefix to the linux_input codes,
to differentiate between devices and other DirectFB-supported input
methods?
