You are right that could be done, but right now I don't plan to do it. 
First I want to have the softdevice running with libavformat and support 
the other audio formats. Hopefully the dvd-plugin will work togther with 
the softdevice after this step and maybe some tuneing. And if the 
dvd-plugin is working, I think the need for a softdevice-only dvd-plugin 
is not that big.
My next step will be to use libavformat to be able to replay avi, mp3 
and others with vdr/softdevice. Including unencrypted .vob support 
should be not to difficult at that step (although I did not check that 
yet), but I certainly don't want to mess around with decss and libdvdnav.


Bye,
Martin
