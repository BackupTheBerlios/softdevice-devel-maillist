I hope that you make it possible to enable and disable the RTC timing
while VDR is running.  I really only want to disable the RTC timing for
the short period when the VDR shutdown script is being invoked.

Any hints for that?  I'm not at all familiar with the internals of VDR;
I started building my VDR setup only a couple of months ago.

&gt;<i> Actualy  on the start of vdr the softdevice should start in the same

That would be an easy workaround and safety option against crashes on
timed recordings.  Unfortunately, softdevice will start playing after reboot,
even if I disable the playback mode and hit 'OK' before hitting the Power
button.  The cropmode setting is properly restored.

&gt;<i> What about this repeatable softdevice crash, was it due to bad signal 
</I>&gt;<i> quality, or something different? If you know how to reproducible crash 
</I>&gt;<i> the softdevice, then please tell us how, so that we can fix it.
</I>
I'm sorry, I didn't save that clip.  That was stupid of me, because it was
really in the very first couple of frames of the saved clip.  I suspect it
was a bad signal, or some dropped packets.

Over the weekend, the nvram-wakeup magic worked, and I recorded a 16:9 film.
When I try to edit it (hit 'Pause' and '9' to go to the first edit mark I
managed to set), VDR will hang until the -w timeout, and on subsequent runs,
VDR will crash every time I press a key on the remote - presumably because
DirectFB is not properly uninitialized on the first run.  The remote control
is mapped via DirectFB's linux_input.  I'm using only the subtitles and
softdevice plugins on VDR 1.3.22.  I'll investigate this further.

I've noticed that softdevice doesn't normally react to changes in the aspect
ratio (4:3 or 16:9).  It does react when skipping in one-minute steps.
