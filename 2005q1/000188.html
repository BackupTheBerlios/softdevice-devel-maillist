</I>It is a similar feature, and it has some advantages over using streamdev 
plugin. I think that the fact there is already a possibility to do 
something one way should not be a reason to include features which allow 
to do the same think an other way. Or maybe we should stop developing 
the softdevice just because there is already vdr-xine ;-)

&gt;&gt;<i>I think if we had a fully working DVD plugin with softdevice there would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>be less use for this feature.
</I>I can think of a lot more things where suspending the video playback is 
very usefull, espacially for people who don't have a vdr-only machine.
I personally like to transcode videos while I do recordings ( my pc is 
on anyway during this time). When I suspend the vdr output I get more 
cpu time for the transcoding and since I usually do the cutting with a 
different program than vdr, I can do that also during a recording.
Or just imagine someone who wants to listen to mp3 with his favourite 
mp3-player while doing a recording...


So like Stefan suggested I will create a menu entry for suspending the 
video. Since I like to have a hotkey for suspending I will leave that 
option too, but make it configurable from the Makefile. Are there some 
suggestions which key should be used? I originally wanted to use 's' but 
  that's already taken for 'Saturation'...
Are there some other objections against including this feature in the 
softdevice?

Bye,
Martin
