Hi!

I tried to use softdevice &amp; bitstreamout on my single budget (Nova-S) 
system with CMI8738 SPDIF-out and external decoder, and I think the 
crash I get is due to the fact that both bitstreamout and softdevice try 
to access the SPDIF.
For me, as I do not have a FF-card with a physical SPDIF output to loop 
through my soundcard and control this with bitstreamout, the best 
solution would be if softdevice could just passthrough DD as well.
Forgot to mention, it's working for  stereo MP2, but not for mono. If 
you could please have a look on this mono issue too (besides DD of 
course ;-), I think the decoded PCM must also be upmixed to stereo, I'm 
suspecting that libavcodec or ffmpeg or whatever you use for decoding in 
softdevice just tries to pass the decoded PCM to the SPDIF as is, and 
I'm not aware of any external decoder to handle mono PCM, as it has to 
be exactly like the stereo PCM on Audio-CDs by the Red book (mono 
material is just too identical channels, too).


Keep up the good work!

P.S. this surely belongs to a new thread, but what about DirectFB output 
on interlaced devices (TV-out of a Matrox G400 for example), has there 
been any improvement in the field parity issues? The output is still 
jerky compared with 'mplayer -vo dfbmga' on the TV. Is it possible to 
completely turn of deinterlacing (as it is not needed at all on a an 
&quot;interlaced-by-nature&quot; device like a standard PAL TV with no fancy 
feateres) and just take care of the right field order?
