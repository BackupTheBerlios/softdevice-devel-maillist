<PRE>&gt;<i> Turn deinterlace OFF. It is not needed in TV-out mode.
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; [dfb] RAM: 8388608 bytes
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Only 8MB are reported, please use the matorx-full-memory patch from DirectFB.
</I>
Okay, these did the trick, it works with mode=720x576. Now the video
flows very well. Only problem seems to be that when there's motion the
video looks pretty crap. I don't know if this called tearing or what and
if it could be fixed by setting some directfb options. Maybe field
parity or something but with quick glance I couldn't find an option for
that in the directfbrc man-page.

&gt;<i> Why the 16 bit mode ? Something from your directfbrc ?
</I>&gt;<i> But the number 0x00200806 should be ok as I posted on vdr list ;-) .
</I>
Well that's because I had commented the depth=32 line in directfbrc. I
thought that it would save some memory.

&gt;<i> &gt; And last some information about my system:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Graphics card: Matrox G450 Dualhead 16 Mb
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Kernel: 2.6.9 (vanilla)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Softdevice and ffmpeg are from today's CVS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Distro: FedoraCore 2
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Whats the CPU type and speed ?
</I>
AMD Athlon XP 1700+ 

One more problem I had was that VDR found an RC unit and it accepted
only keyboard input. Next it asked to configure the keyboard. Then it
didn't accept the keyboard buttons anymore. I solved the problem by
compiling VDR without keyboard input possibility. My keyboard is
wireless and currently connected to ps/2 port but it can be connected to
USB port as well and maybe I'll try that if I have some time. But most
important, now I get the picture so thank you!

Few more questions about that RGB via VGA connector method described on
the softdevice homepage. Is that setup supposed to be used with
framebuffer output driver with softdevice? Are you using matroxset
program and perhaps how?

Did you use the VGA connector pinout from matrox to connect the VGA
connector cable?

<A HREF="http://forum.matrox.com/mga/viewtopic.php?t=4381">http://forum.matrox.com/mga/viewtopic.php?t=4381</A>

All other pins are clear to me but the pin 16 (blanking) on the scart
side of the schematic

<A HREF="http://www.sm.go.dlr.de/%7Ebob/scart/scart.gif">http://www.sm.go.dlr.de/%7Ebob/scart/scart.gif</A>

makes me wonder. Is it connected to the TTL vertical sync pin (14) on
the VGA connector? 

And one more question: Does anyone know if G450 can generate intercaled
signal and from which connectors? I read that G450 is a stripped version
of G400.
