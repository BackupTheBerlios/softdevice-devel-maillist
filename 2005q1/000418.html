I hope it won't consume more processing power than the RTC method.  I might
give oprofile a try, because my 900 MHz Celeron system does not seem to be
fast enough for fast moving scenes.  I recently ran oprofile on MySQL 5.0.3
and managed to get some 10% performance improvement for my test case after
some tweaks.

</I>
Thanks! Of course, a cleaner way would be to introduce a virtual method
void suspendPlayback(bool) that all plugins could override.  That would
have some chance of being included in some VDR release.  But let's hope
first that you can get rid of /dev/rtc without sacrificing processing
power.

&gt;<i> Did you try that with the latest CVS? The parsing of the Suspend option 
</I>&gt;<i> was missing, I added it a few days after your first mail.
</I>
Now I tried the latest CVS on VDR 1.3.22 and 1.3.23, and subtitles-plugin
0.3.7 (<A HREF="http://www.virtanen.org/vdr/subtitles/">http://www.virtanen.org/vdr/subtitles/</A>).  Unfortunately, I don't
see any subtitles with the latest CVS, neither from live stream nor from
recordings.  I updated only the setup parsing code from the CVS version,
and it worked.  On a related note, does softdevice implement the GetSTC
method accurately?  The subtitles plugin needs that for displaying the
subtitles at the right time.  (They are usually transmitted a couple of
seconds before they should be displayed, and now it seems that the
subtitles are displayed too early.)

&gt;<i> Crashes caused by bad signal a mostly due to ffmpeg, so they are less 
</I>&gt;<i> interesting for us. Although we might have some bugs ( or missing 
</I>&gt;<i> checks) in our code too, which case crashes on bad signal.
</I>
Well, such crashes affect the overall usability of the product.  I think
it's a design flaw to have assertions fail on garbage input.  It's so likely
to get garbage DVB data.  Next time when I get such a crash, I promise to
save the clip and to analyze it further.

&gt;<i> &gt;When I try to edit it (hit 'Pause' and '9' to go to the first edit mark I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;managed to set), VDR will hang until the -w timeout, and on subsequent 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;runs,

</I>
As someone suggested, using LinuxThreads instead of NPTL removed the hang.
Does anyone know if this is a bug in NPTL, or just changed semantics that
needs to be accounted for in the code?  I have the impression that also
MySQL prefers LinuxThreads over NPTL, but I don't know exactly why.
