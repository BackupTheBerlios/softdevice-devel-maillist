But there are a few things. With xv-out and startup aspect wide, and crop
mode 16:9 the full OSD is scaled correct and full visible, but the
info OSD at bottom of the screen is mostly invisible.
With fb-out there are some positioning problems when I tried it at
1280x1024x16.

I wondered if changing the GRAPHIC_KEY function is correct. Did you try
it with &quot;#if 0&quot; instead of &quot;#if RAGE128&quot;. In total there are only a very
few applications out there, which use and rely on colorkeying working
correct.

&gt;<i> I did not inted to change the color key in vidix, I was just playing

</I>&gt;<i> commiting :-o. Hehm, so I think it is the best to put the old values back.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I saw that you commited a subplugin concept for the video out methods,

</I>&gt;<i> I will try it when I'm at home.

</I>
Done. Pointer to remaining option string is now in setup store
(for vo and ao).

&gt;<i> We could get rid of most of the ugly #ifdefs in softdevice.c.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't now if this is possible, but I would also like to have to

</I>&gt;<i> corresponding to the capabilities of the graphics card to have them 
</I>&gt;<i> modified from OSD. And we would get rid of all those shortcut keys which 
</I>&gt;<i> are used right now in Xv-out to modify the values :-).
</I>
That would be nice too. But the most important thing to my opinion is:
AC3 out .
