<PRE>Hi Stefan,

thanks for fixing all those bugs while I was away!!! It seems you did 
not leave much for me to fix ;-)
I had a short look at the softdevice yesterday, but I did not have the 
time to test anything.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll leave vidix color key for now. We have to check that later. If you
</I>&gt;<i> are using a rage128 for your test, this maybe a driver bug as they (vidix)
</I>&gt;<i> treat rage128 a bit different.
</I>&gt;<i> if function set_gr_key (..)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #ifdef RAGE128
</I>&gt;<i> 	besr.graphics_key_msk=(1&lt;&lt;dbpp)-1;
</I>&gt;<i> 	besr.ckey_cntl = VIDEO_KEY_FN_TRUE|GRAPHIC_KEY_FN_NE|CMP_MIX_AND;
</I>&gt;<i> #else
</I>&gt;<i> 	besr.graphics_key_msk=besr.graphics_key_clr;
</I>&gt;<i> 	besr.ckey_cntl = VIDEO_KEY_FN_TRUE|CMP_MIX_AND|GRAPHIC_KEY_FN_EQ;
</I>&gt;<i> #endif
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Yes, for some reason my Rage128pro seems to behave quite different than 
other cards, it's similar for vidix and dfb. I guess I have to talk to 
the vidix guys and ask them.
I did not inted to change the color key in vidix, I was just playing 
around with it and I missed that I didn't take back the changes before 
commiting :-o. Hehm, so I think it is the best to put the old values back.

I saw that you commited a subplugin concept for the video out methods, 
after takeing a first glance at it, it looks very promising. Great work! 
I will try it when I'm at home.
Do you plan to go further? I could imagine to move all video out method 
specific comandline parsing to the video clases just by passing the 
string following the &quot;-vo xxx:&quot; to the constructor of video out methods. 
We could get rid of most of the ugly #ifdefs in softdevice.c.
I don't now if this is possible, but I would also like to have to 
possibility to create menu items from the video clases. This way for 
example Xv could create menu items for saturation,hue,... at runtime 
corresponding to the capabilities of the graphics card to have them 
modified from OSD. And we would get rid of all those shortcut keys which 
are used right now in Xv-out to modify the values :-).

Bye,
Martin
