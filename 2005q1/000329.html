<PRE>Hi,


I checked out last night's CVS (after Martin committed the new 
mpeg2decoder), and I must say, this is getting very interesting for me now:
  - I no longer have field parity artifacts on my G400 TV-out 
(DirectFB), only every few seconds there seems to be a jump, but 
otherwise the image is as it should be, I'm very pleased.
  - the new libavformat parsing code gives me software AC3 decoding (of 
course, I still would like to find out how to let ffmpeg just 
passthrough AC3 to the SPDIF);
  - the new tracing printed on the console comes very handy for 
analysing some MP2-related issues, let me give you some examples:

1.)
CMD[6295]:Neuer Thread gestartet: Mpeg2Decoder pid 17562
CMD[7646]:Neuer StreamDecoder type 17562
CMD[7700]:Neuer Thread gestartet: pid:17562 type 1
alsa-audio: SetParams
Input #0, mpeg, from 'test':
    Duration: N/A, bitrate: N/A
    Stream #0.0: Audio: mp2, 48000 Hz, mono, 96 kb/s

On this channel, I have no sound on the SPDIF, because the stream is 
mono and I think it should be upmixed to stereo. BTW, this is a romanian 
  channel on EutelsatW2.

2.)
CMD[7480]:Neuer Thread gestartet: pid:18720 type 1
alsa-audio: SetParams
Input #0, mpeg, from 'test':
    Duration: N/A, bitrate: N/A
    Stream #0.0: Video: mpeg2video, 528x576, 25.00 fps, 15000 kb/s
    Stream #0.1: Audio: mp2, 48000 Hz, mono, 128 kb/s

Same as above, only this is CNN on Astra 19.2E, you could tune to this 
one yourself if you use SPDIF and could debug the problem. Note the 
different bitrate, in the following examples there is more about bitrate.

3.)
CMD[6143]:Neuer StreamDecoder type 18720
CMD[6154]:Neuer Thread gestartet: pid:18720 type 1
alsa-audio: SetParams
Input #0, mpeg, from 'test':
    Duration: N/A, bitrate: N/A
    Stream #0.0: Video: mpeg2video, 704x576, 25.00 fps, 3840 kb/s
    Stream #0.1: Audio: mp2, 48000 Hz, stereo, 128 kb/s

On this one I have sound, like I always did, but with the new code there 
is an approx. 1 second offset betwwen audio and video (audio ahead of video)


4.)
CMD[1501]:Neuer Thread gestartet: pid:18720 type 1
alsa-audio: Xrun
Input #0, mpeg, from 'test':
    Duration: N/A, bitrate: N/A
    Stream #0.0: Video: mpeg2video, 720x576, 25.00 fps, 15000 kb/s
    Stream #0.1: Audio: ac3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 448 kb/s

This one was Pro7 when broadcasting DD 2.0, I have sound now but 
software decoded and passed as stereo PCM to the SPDIF, with a very big 
sync offset as well;


5.)
CMD[7496]:Neuer Thread gestartet: pid:18720 type 1
alsa-audio: SetParams
Input #0, mpeg, from 'test':
    Duration: N/A, bitrate: N/A
    Stream #0.0: Video: mpeg2video, 480x576, 25.00 fps, 7980 kb/s
    Stream #0.1: Audio: mp2, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kb/s

Now, this one is very, very interesting! This was the french channel TV5 
and it was in lipsync! Is it due to the bitrate of 192 kb/s?



As you see, I found some very distinct and reproducible scenarios, maybe 
you can conclude few things from them, as you know your code best. for 
instance, this A/V-sync stuff depending on the bitrate.

Did samething actually changed in the DirectFB code what caused the 
benefic effect that I no longer see field parity artifacts not even on 
horizontally scrollin text banners (except a jump every 1-3 seconds, 
maybe a re-sync attempt, I don't know)? Or is it due to the fact that 
the audio stream parsing or even decoding is done differently? Or did 
you changed something in the threading scheme of the plugin?
Maybe all these are worth analyzing, I don't know, I'm just suggesting 
you should give it a thought.


Otherwise, great work, keep it up guys!
