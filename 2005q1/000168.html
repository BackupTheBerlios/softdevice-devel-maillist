I'm sorry that I'm answering so late... I'm also working on a different 
patch, I still have some unfinished patches around which I want to 
finish bevore I start to work on the inclusion of libavformat for the 
parsing.
I think we should not delay the development of the softdevice for a 
working dvd-plugin, so lets make the softdevice compatible with 
vdr-1.3.18 and than look for the dvd-plugin. And I also think we should 
not put too much work into the patch I send around, it will be obsolete 
anyway if we move to parsing with libavformat... I just proposed to 
include it into cvs because it was working without any problems for me, 
and I didn't expect that there will be problems. Ah yes, and I found a 
small bug in the calculation of the audio pts, it still uses a fixed 
bitrate and number of channels, I will fix this in the cvs this 
afternoon. So maybe this is the reason for the problems with the sync...

So if it is not too much trouble you can still try the patch, I'm 
curious if it is working for someone else without problems, but don't 
spend too much time with it if its not working...

Martin
