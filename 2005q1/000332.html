</I>Can you send me how you start the vdr and with exactly what parameters, 
plugins etc.(send the command line or the appropriate parts of runvdr)? 
That would make it easy to conclude things.
If you are right and your soundcard repacks the pcm and sends it to 
SPDIF out, we will have trouble syncing... There seems to be a buffer 
either in the soundcard or in your ac3 decoder of unknown size which has 
to be taken into account and may be different for different machines. 
Hmm, I have to think about that... But I think we should wait for some 
more reports before concluding anything.

&gt;<i>

</I>I did not intend to change something, and I don't know what may have

Concering this field parity issue, I aggree now with Stefan who already 
suggested a long time ago to add an option to sync the audio to the 
video ( not the other way around like we are doing it now). This kind of 
option make certainly sense for TV-out, and should finally solve these 
issues. The only problem is that we need a good resampler and the ffmpeg 
resampler can't cope with resampling rate changes. So this is on my todo 
list.
I will also consider an option to resample mono to stereo and 5.1 audio 
to stereo. This should not be to difficult.

Thank you for your report!

Martin
