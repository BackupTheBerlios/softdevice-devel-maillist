</I>&gt;<i> while VDR is running.  I really only want to disable the RTC timing for
</I>&gt;<i> the short period when the VDR shutdown script is being invoked.
</I>I was about to add a switch the last weekend, but now I'm thinking about 
replacing the RTC timing by an signal triggered timing. I did not check 
the precision of this method yet but it looks very promising to me. So 
maybe we will get rid of the /dev/rtc usage at all.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Is there any simple and reliable way to control the softdevice playback 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>mode
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>from vdr.c?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>As far as I now not. But maybe you can the softdevice's setupStore, then 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>it would be possible..
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any hints for that?  I'm not at all familiar with the internals of VDR;
</I>&gt;<i> I started building my VDR setup only a couple of months ago.
</I>Check vdrs plugin.h/c: basically you should be able to use 
pluginMangager-&gt;GetPlugin(&quot;softdevice&quot;) to get a pointer to the 
softdevice plugin. Then call softdevice-&gt;SetupParse(&quot;Suspend&quot;,&quot;1&quot;). 
Check with setup-softdevice.c.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Actualy  on the start of vdr the softdevice should start in the same 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>playback mode it was when the vdr was stopped, provided it saved the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>setupSore, but I never tried that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That would be an easy workaround and safety option against crashes on
</I>&gt;<i> timed recordings.  Unfortunately, softdevice will start playing after reboot,
</I>&gt;<i> even if I disable the playback mode and hit 'OK' before hitting the Power
</I>&gt;<i> button.  The cropmode setting is properly restored.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Did you try that with the latest CVS? The parsing of the Suspend option 
was missing, I added it a few days after your first mail.
&gt;&gt;<i>What about this repeatable softdevice crash, was it due to bad signal 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>quality, or something different? If you know how to reproducible crash 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the softdevice, then please tell us how, so that we can fix it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sorry, I didn't save that clip.  That was stupid of me, because it was
</I>&gt;<i> really in the very first couple of frames of the saved clip.  I suspect it
</I>&gt;<i> was a bad signal, or some dropped packets.
</I>Crashes caused by bad signal a mostly due to ffmpeg, so they are less 
interesting for us. Although we might have some bugs ( or missing 
checks) in our code too, which case crashes on bad signal.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Over the weekend, the nvram-wakeup magic worked, and I recorded a 16:9 film.
</I>&gt;<i> When I try to edit it (hit 'Pause' and '9' to go to the first edit mark I
</I>&gt;<i> managed to set), VDR will hang until the -w timeout, and on subsequent runs,
</I>
Thanks for your report, I'm currently not at home so I can not check it 
and fix it. But this may be related to the pause-&gt;play deadlock Stefan 
reported. I will try to fix it as soon as I'm at home again.
