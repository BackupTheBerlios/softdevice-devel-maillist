I started vdr from a ssh console like:

  vdr -c /etc/vdr -L /usr/lib/vdr -P'softdevice -L /usr/lib/vdr -vo 
dfb:mgatv'

</I>

Now that you asked me about -ao dummy, I tried it, and it seemed to 
behave the same. I thought this one disables sound for use with 
bitstreamout for FF-card owners who would want to decode with softdevice 
(might make sense for HDTV, right ;-) ?) I couldn't make detailed 
testing now, because we have to leave for now. Will check the ML when 
I'm back.

&gt;<i> Concering this field parity issue, I aggree now with Stefan who already 
</I>&gt;<i> suggested a long time ago to add an option to sync the audio to the 
</I>&gt;<i> video ( not the other way around like we are doing it now). This kind of 
</I>&gt;<i> option make certainly sense for TV-out, and should finally solve these 
</I>&gt;<i> issues. The only problem is that we need a good resampler and the ffmpeg 
</I>&gt;<i> resampler can't cope with resampling rate changes. So this is on my todo 
</I>&gt;<i> list.
</I>&gt;<i> I will also consider an option to resample mono to stereo and 5.1 audio 
</I>&gt;<i> to stereo. This should not be to difficult.
</I>
Hopefully these two things will be handled separately for MP2 and DD.

&gt;<i> Thank you for your report!
</I>
I thank you for this whole work ;-)
