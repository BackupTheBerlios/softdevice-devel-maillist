</I>
I want to keep the softdevice as simple and small as possible, and my 
plans are to make the code more simple.

Maybe I didn't explain my goals the right way... Currently all 
postprocessing is done in mpeg2decoder.c, which means that there are a 
lot of #ifdefs,#else and #endif around to respect the compile options. 
Also the picture buffers for mirroring, deinterlacing and ffmpeg 
postproc are allocated from cMpeg2Decoder, as well as the interface to 
the underlying libraries is in cMpeg2Decoder.
What I plan to do is to move all this code to seperate classes. All what 
would be neccesary in cMpeg2Deocder would be a call like 
&quot;PrepareForDisplay(.. )&quot; to the postprocessing filters right after a 
frame is decoded, and then some kind of &quot;Display()&quot; call when the frame 
should be displayed. As I said I don't plan to have shared libraries, 
but I want to have a common interface for the postprocessing filters 
and not have them entangled with the video decoding.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe AC3 and/or hardware MPEG2 decoding would be easier with it ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
AC3 decoding and XvMC support is already in the ffmpeg library, so 
currently I don't think we need another library.

Bye,
Martin
