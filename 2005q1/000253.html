</I>Can you be a bit more precise? My poor old Athlon can hardly do the 
640x480x15 fb-out, so that's hard for me to test... Not speaking of my 
old monitor which is only capable of doing the 1280x1024 at eye hurting 
60Hz... I guess I have to buy a new machine soon ;-)
Right now I'm already working on using libavformat for the parsing, but 
I will have to change the software osd again after finishing the 
libavformat stuff. That will be the perfect opertunity to do bug 
hunting, so please tell all problems you know, that I can fix them.

&gt;<i> That would be nice too. But the most important thing to my opinion is:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>In fact I already have a early version which understands ac3 :-)
But there is still a lot to do, as this version is not very stable, A-V 
sync is broken ( and so on and so on...its almost a complete rewrite of 
mpeg2decoder.c) and I will be away for another week from thursday on... 
So I guess it will take at least 2-3 weeks before I can present a quite 
stable version.

Inspired by your work with the subplugins I will create a general 
interface for video filters like deinterleace and postproc. I plan to 
use some kind of filter queue which can be plugged between the mpeg 
decoder and the video out ( but not with shared libraries). Creating 
additional filters like image scalers or format conversion would be a 
lot easier then and could be used for all video out methods. Finally I 
don't like to have the filters in the mpeg2decoder. They have nothing to 
do with mpeg2 decoding, it's postprocessing what they are doing...

I'm also using your subplugin option now and it works wunderfull!

Bye,
Martin
