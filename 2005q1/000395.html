It's a standard 4:3 PAL TV.

&gt;<i> If its a 4:3 type, was/is the video shown 4:3 or 16:9 ?
</I>
Aspect ration setting is set to &quot;PAL 4:3&quot; or something (I'm at wortk 
right now, don't remember the exact name), and I didn't notice any wrong 
shown aspect, I mean material broadcasted 4:3 looked OK, and on the rare 
16:9 broadcasts, softdevice seems to correctly scale the video.

&gt;<i> Do you see judder on all channels ? and on each invocation ?
</I>
On pretty all channels. I always call vdr with the softdevice from a ssh 
session with
vdr -c /etc/vdr -L /usr/lib/vdr -P'softdevice -L /usr/lib/vdr -vo:mgatv' 
-P'graphlcd -d noritake800'

&gt;<i> You previously said field parity issue is back. On which exact
</I>&gt;<i> version of video-dfb was it gone ?
</I>
Well, I started that thread &quot;CVS from last night feedback  - field 
parity seems to be solved :-) , some audio issues remain&quot; on friday, the 
18.03. I would say it was the previuos version (1.19) of video-dfb.c and 
1.5 of video-dfb.h. But it could also happen that other changed code was 
the reason for that, Martin replied at that time he didn't change 
anything in video-dfb, but in mpeg2decoder.c, maybe rev 1.21 and/or 1.22 
where OK for me at that time.
I think the field parity problem coming back might be related to the 
syncing modifications, I don't know...

In a previous message you said you tested with &quot;Radeon-9200, G550 vga + 
tv-out and G400 as mentioned above. On G400 I've still some problems but 
this is probably caused by the old DFB version on that system (0.9.20)&quot;

Now I'm not getting it, did you test TV-out an both G450 and G400, and 
you see no field parity issues on scrolling newstickers like n24 and the 
like?

Tonight after getting back home from work I'll try to checkout again a 
softdevice CVS as of 18-19 march to see if I was right with the field 
parity, then I'll tell you the exact snapshot I tested if relevant, you 
might then test the very same version on G400 TV-out for yourself, would 
that help? Because for me the modifications spread all over in various 
areas of softdevice are still too complex to get the grand picture in my 
head to diagnose this...

Thank you all for the support,
Lucian
