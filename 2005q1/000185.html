</I>
Isn't that the same as terminating your vdr-client and let the vdr-server
up and running :-) ? Yes that would require a better streamdev plugin ..
and a way to highjack the server OSD to the client. The last is one of
my greatest whishes as my vdr-server downstairs has no graphic and
audio output device :-( (vdr-server based video cutting, .. ).

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's is less useful in my view.
</I>
For dfb-out due to startup mode with SetCooperativeLevel(DLSCL_ADMINISTRATIVE);
it would be more or less the same as delete videoOut; ...
videoOut = new cMETHODVideoOut (..);.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think if we had a fully working DVD plugin with softdevice there would
</I>&gt;<i> be less use for this feature.
</I>
So we should focus on more compatibility with some other plugins and have 
a player like Martin suggested for other video stream types which are
supported by ffmpeg. To get the dvd plugin work again, I think looking at
recent changes of vdr output method PlayPES()  instead of playvideo()
(wondering why it still works with vdr-1.3.18).

When targeting upon inclusion into distributions (binary) we should have
our own sub-plugin loader for runtime loading the output device handler. By
this vdr would not fail on startup while loading libvdr-softdevice.so.1.x.y on
a system that has only support for directfb, but not for X11. This would still
allow that all output methods are selected at build time.
