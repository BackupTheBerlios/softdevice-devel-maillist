Stream id 0x01bd (private stream) is used for ac3 too. But we get the ac3
via PlayAudio ( .. ) .

&gt;<i> The way I would prefer to do it, would be to switch the whole parsing of

</I>&gt;<i> AVPacket to send the audio and video streams to the appropriate decoder. 
</I>&gt;<i> This way we would be prepared to handle all the codecs libavcodec can

</I>
Yes :-)) .

&gt;<i> We could easily replay .avi files with vdr, we

</I>
That should be the way to go. Hopefully this could be done without patching
vdr. Normal cDevice has to method of specifying different output formats.

&gt;<i> We could also get rid of the 
</I>&gt;<i> double parsing of the PES headers in the mpeg decoder, and have instead 
</I>&gt;<i> the well tested ffmpeg parser. But that would mean to almost completly 
</I>&gt;<i> rewrite mpegdecoder.c. I hope to find the time to do this in a not too 
</I>&gt;<i> far future...
</I>
So I'll hope that too :-). 

&gt;<i> Anyway, for now I would like to ask you to try out this patch, and if 
</I>&gt;<i> there are no complaints or objections I will commit this patch in a few 
</I>&gt;<i> days.
</I>
I tested this with vdr-1.3.17. Just with two different dvds. Xv-out method.

- Contact
	aspect ratio ok, sound complete out of sync,
	video jerky (as no one throttles us).

- Herr der Ringe, die zwei T&#252;rme
	aspect ratio wrong (shown as 4:3 within my 1024x768 window),
	sound out of sync, video jerky (as no one throttles us).

The first time I tried it, I had an error accessing my dvd device. After
returning to tv live mode there was a terrible sound: beeps, zirps and wistles.
This happend only once and I don't know how to reproduce this.
